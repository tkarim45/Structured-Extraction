Guidance Note on Operational Risk Management  and Operational Resilience  
RBI/202 4-25/ 31 
DOR.ORG.REC. 21/14.10.001/2024- 25         April 30, 2024 
         
1.  Purpose  
1.1 Operational Risk  is inherent in all banking/ financial  products, services, 
activities, processes , and systems . Effective management of Operational Risk  is an 
integral part of the Regulated Entities’ (REs)  risk management framework. Sound 
Management of Operational Risk  shows the overall effectiveness of the B oard of 
Directors and S enior Management in administering the RE’s portfolio of products,  
services, activities, processes , and systems.   
1.2  An operational disruption can threaten the viability of an RE, impact  its 
customers and other market participants, and ultimately have an impact on f inancial 
stability. It can result from man- made causes , Information Technology (IT) threats 
(e.g., cyber -attacks, changes in technology, technology failures , etc), geopolitical 
conflicts , business disruptions,  internal/external frauds, execution/ delivery errors, 
third party dependencies , or natural causes (e.g.,  climate change, pandemic , etc.).  
1.3  An RE needs to factor in the entire gamut of risks  (including the aforesaid 
risks in its risk assessment policies/ processes), identify and assess them using 
appropriate tools, monitor  its material operational exposures  and devise appropriate 
risk mitigation /management  strategies using strong internal controls to minimize 
operational disruptions and continue to deliver critical operations, thus ensuring 
operati onal resilience.  
1.4  Until recently, the predominant Operational Risks that REs faced emanated 
from vulnerabilities related to increasing dependence and rapid adoption of technology  for provision of financial services and intermediation. However, the 
2 
 financial sector’s growing  reliance on third- party providers  (including technology 
service providers)  exacerbated by Covid- 19 pandemic with greater reliance on virtual 
working arrangements, has highlighted the increasing importance of Operational 
Risk Managem ent and Operational Resilience ; which  not only benefit s the RE by 
strengthening its ability to remain a viable going concern but also supports  the 
financial system  by ensuring continuous delivery of critical  operations  during any 
disruption.  
1.5  In view of the foregoing, the Reserve Bank, through this Guidance Note on 
Operational Risk Management  and Operational Resilience (hereafter ‘Guidance 
Note’)  intends t o: 
1.5.1 promote and further improve  the effectiveness of Operational Risk 
Management  of the REs, and 
1.5.2 enhance their Operational Resilience given the interconnections and 
interdependencies, within the financial system, that result from the complex and 
dynamic environment in which the REs  operate. 
1.6  This Guidance Note updates the “Guidance Note on Management of 
Operational Risk” dated October 14, 2005. It  has  been prepared based on the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)  principles document s issued in March 
2021, viz., (a) ‘Revisions to the Principles for the Sound Management of Operational 
Risk’ and (b) ‘Principles for O perational Resilience’  as well as the some of the 
international best practices . 
1.7  The Guidance Note has adopted a principle -based and proportionate approach 
to ensure smooth implementation across REs of various sizes, nature, complexity, 
geographic location and risk profile of their business es. Although the exact approach 
may vary from RE to RE, t he Guidance Note provides an overarching guidance to 
REs for improving and further strengthening their  Operational Risk Management  
Framework (ORMF). It gives adequate flexibility to REs for Operational Risk 
Management  to enhance their ability to withstand, adapt and recover from potential 
operational disruptions  and ensure their Operational Resilience. T he systems, 
procedures and tools prescribed in this Guidance Note are indicative in nature and 
should be read in conjunction with the relevant instructions issued by Reserve Bank  
from time to time.  In case of inconsistency , if any, the relevant instructions issued by 
the Reserve Bank would prevail.  
3 
 1.8  The operational risk regulatory capital requirements shall continue to be 
guided by the applicable guidelines1. 
2.  Application 
2.1 This Guidance Note shall apply  to the following REs : 
2.1.1 All Commercial Banks2;  
2.1.2 All Primary (Urban) Co -operative Banks/State Co- operative Banks/ Central 
Co-operative Banks;   
2.1.3 All All- India Financial Institutions (viz. , Exim Bank, NABARD, NHB, SIDBI, and 
NaBFID) ; and 
2.1.4 All Non -Banking Financial Companies including Housing Finance Companies .  
3. Repeal and Transitional Arrangements 
With the issuance of this Guidance Note the “Guidance Note on Management of 
Operational Risk” dated October 14, 2005, s tands repealed.  
4. Key changes  
Key changes carried out in this Guidance Note vis -à-vis the repealed Guidance Note 
are given in Annex .

1 The approach for operational risk capital calculation for banks is detailed in “Master Circular – Basel III Capital Regulations” 
dated April 1 , 2024 , as amended from time to time. Ho wever, REs such as Small Finance Banks, Payments Banks, Regional 
Rural Banks, Local Area Banks, NBFCs, and Co- operative Banks  are not required to maintain separate regulatory capital for 
operational risk.  
2 “Commercial Banks” means all banking companies, corresponding new banks, Regional Rural Banks and State Bank of India 
as defined under subsections (c), (da), (ja) and (nc) of Section 5 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. This also includes banks 
incorporated outside India and licensed to operate in India (‘Foreign Banks’), Local Area Banks, Payments Banks, and Small 
Finance Banks.

 1.  PRELIMINARY  
1.1 Introduction 
1.1.1 The global financial crisis greatly impacted financial stability around the world. 
Given the fact that the effects of crisis were much more severe than all the scenarios 
envisaged by bank s as part of their stress tests, several  structural changes were 
undertaken to strengthen banks’/financial institutions ’ financial resilience. Though  
capital and liquidity requirements have improved the ability of banks to absorb 
shocks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) was of the view that more 
work needs to be done in the area of Operational Risk Management  to provide 
additional safeguards to the financial system.  
1.1.2 The BCBS recognized Operational Risk  as a distinct class of risk in 2001, 
outside of credit and market risks  and came out with Sound Practices for 
Management and Supervision of Operational Risk  in 2003. Subsequently, these 
principles were revised in 2011 , to incorporate the lessons learnt from the Great 
Financial Crisis of 2007- 09. In 2014, a review of the implementation of these 
Principles was carried out to assess the extent  to which banks had implemented 
these Principles, identify significant gaps, if any, in their implementation and highlight 
emerging and noteworthy Operational Risk Management  practices at banks which 
may be included in the Principles. It was also observed that several Principles have 
not yet been adequately implemented, and there was a need for further guidance to facilitate their implementation in areas such as risk identification and assessment tools, key risk indicators, business process mapping, monitor ing of action plans, 
change management programmes and processes, implementation of the three lines of defence, oversight by Board of Directors and S enior Management, articulation of 
Operational Risk  appetite and tolerance statements, risk disclosures, etc.  BCBS also 
recognised that the 2011 Principles did not adequately capture certain important sources of Operational Risk , such as those arising from Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) risk.  
1.1.3  Subsequently, the onset of Covid- 19 pandemic created disruptions affecting 
information systems, personnel, facilities, relationships with third- party service 
providers and customers. It altered the way banks  operated in view of their increased 
demands on technology given the greater reliance on virtual working arrangements.  
In addition, incidents of cyber threats (ransomware attacks, phishing, etc .) spiked, 
3 
 and the likelihood  for materialising of the Operational Risk  events caused by people, 
failed processes , and systems increased, which tested the operational resilience of 
banks .  
1.1.4 In light of the same, BCBS felt that further work was necessary to strengthen 
banks’ ability to withstand Operational Risk  related events such as pandemics, cyber 
incidents, technology failures and natural disasters which could cause significant 
operational failures or widespread disruptions in financial markets. It is in this 
backdrop, that BCBS came out with updated ‘Principles  for the Sound Management 
of Operational Risk ’ in 2021. Additionally, it also came out with ‘Principles  on 
Operational Resilience’  to enhance the ability of banks  to withstand, adapt to and 
recover from potential hazards . 
1.2 Background 
1.2.1  Operational Risk  is a complex  risk category , when it comes to identification, 
quantification and mitigation of risk . It is impacted by numerous factors such as 
internal business processes, regulatory landscape, business growth, customer preferences, and even factors external to the organization. It is highly dynamic in 
nature where new and emerging forces such as breakthrough technologies, data availability, new business models, interaction with third parties, etc., continuously 
create new demands on Operational Risk Management Framework ( ORMF ).  
1.2.2  While Operational Risk Management  allows a n RE to better identify, assess 
and mitigate the Operational Risk s, Operational Resilience provides it the ability to 
deliver critical functions in the event of any disruption. Although Operational Risk 
Management  and Operational Resilience address different goals, they ar e closely 
interconnected. An effective Operational Risk Management  system and a robust 
level of O perational Resilience work together to reduce the frequency and the impact 
of Operational Risk  events.  In view of the above, Reserve Bank, through this 
Guidanc e Note intends to promote Operational Risk Management  and enhance the 
Operational Resilience  of REs.  
1.2.3 This Guidance Note on Operational Risk Management  and Operational 
Resilience has been built on three pillars . The three pillars are:  
(i) Prepare and Prot ect 
(ii) Build Resilience  
4 
 (iii) Learn and Adapt  
 
 
1.2.4 These three pillars support a holistic approach to the management of 
Operational Risk  and Operational Resilience and create a feedback loop that fosters 
perpetual embedding of lessons learned into an RE’s preparation for operational 
disruptions  and its performance during actual occurrence of disruptions .  
Across these three pillars, the Guidance Note contains 17 principles d etailed  
hereafter in paragraphs 4-18. 
2.  Definitions  
2.1 “Business unit”  is responsible for identifying and managing the risks 
inherent in the products,  services,  activities, processes and syst ems for which it is 
5 
 accountable and includes all associated support, corporate and/or shared service 
functions, e. g., Finance, Human Resources, and Operations and Technology. It does 
not include Risk Management and Internal Audit functions  unless otherwise 
specifically indicated . 
2.2 “Critical operations” refers to critical functions3, activities, processes, 
services and their relevant supporting assets4 the disruption of which would be 
material to the continued operation of the RE or its role in the financial system. 
Whether a particular operation is “critical” depends on the nature of the RE and its 
role in the financial system. REs ’ tolerance for disruption should be applied at the 
critical operations level.  
2.3 “Event management”  is the process of identification, analysis, end- to-end 
management and reporting of an operational risk event that follows a pre- determined 
set of protocols . 
2.4 “Incidents”  are current or past disruptive events the occurrence of which 
would have an adverse effect on critical operations of the RE. Incident management 
is the process of identifying, analysing, rectifying and learning from an incident  
(including a cyber incident)  and preventing recurrences or mitigating the severity 
thereof. The goal of incident management is to limit the disruption and restore critical 
operations in line with the RE’s risk tolerance for disruption.  
2.5 “Information and C ommunication Technology ”5 refers to the underlying 
physical and logical design of information technology and communication systems, 
the individual hardware and software components, data, and the operating 
environment.  
2.6 “Mapping” is the process of identifyi ng, documenting, and understanding the 
chain of activities involved in delivering critical operations . It incorporates the 
                                                            
3 According to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), critical functions are defined as “activities performed for third parties where 
failure would lead to the disruption of services that are vital for the functioning of the real economy and for financial sta bility due 
to the RE’s group size or market share, external and internal interconnectedness, complexity and cross -border activities. 
Examples include payments, custody, certain lending and deposit- taking activities in the commercial or retail sector, clearing 
and s ettling, limited segments of wholesale markets, market making in certain securities and highly concentrated specialist 
lending sectors.”  (FSB’s guidance on ‘ Recovery and resolution planning for systemically important financial institutions: 
guidance on identification of critical functions and critical shared services’ , dated July 16, 2013)  
4 In this context, “supporting assets” are defined as people, technology, information and facilities necessary for the delivery  of 
critical operations.  
5 As per the Nati onal Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), USA , Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) 
encompasses all technologies for the capture, storage, retrieval, processing, display, representation, organization, 
management, security, transfer, and interchange of data and information. 
6 
 identification of all interdependencies and interconnections including people, 
processes , technology and third parties.  
2.7 “Operational resilience” means the ability of an  RE to deliver critical 
operations through disruption. This ability enables an  RE to identify and protect itself 
from threats and potential failures, respond and adapt to, as well as recover and learn from disruptive events to  minimise their  impact on the delivery of critical 
operations through disruption. In considering its operational resilience, an  RE should 
assume that disruptions will occur, and take into account its overall risk appetite and tolerance for disruption or impact tolerance.   
2.8 “Operational Risk” means  the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed 
internal processes, people and systems or from external events. It includes legal risk 
but excludes strategic and reputational risk and it is inherent in all banking/ financial  
products, activities, processes and systems . 
2.9 “Operational Risk Management ” Operational Risk Management refers to 
entire gamut of activities right from risk identification, measurement and assessment, monitoring and control, mitigation, reporting t o senior management and the B oard of 
Directors on the RE’s risk exposures , Business Continuity Management, and 
learning through feedback for improvement.  
2.10 “Operational Risk profiles” describe the Operational Risk  exposures and 
control environment asses sments of business units of REs and it consider s the 
range of potential impacts that could arise from estimates of expected to plausible severe losses.  
2.11 “Regulated Entities” (REs) refers to the entities mentioned below:  
2.11.1  All Commercial Banks
6;  
2.11.2  All Primary (Urban) Co -operative Banks/State Co- operative Banks/ Central 
Co-operative Banks;   
2.11.3  All All-India Financial Institutions  (AIFIs)  (viz., Exim Bank, NABARD, NHB, 
SIDBI, and NaBFID) ; and 
                                                            
6 “Commercial Banks” means all banking companies, corresponding new banks, Regional Rural Banks and State Bank of India 
as defined under subsections (c), (da), (ja) and (nc) of Section 5 of the Banking Regulation Ac t, 1949. This also includes banks 
incorporated outside India licensed to operate in India (‘Foreign Banks’), Local Area Banks, Payments Banks, and Small 
Finance Banks.  
 
7 
 2.11.4  All Non -Banking Financial Companies  (NBFCs)  including Housing Finance 
Companies .  
2.12 “ Respective functions” refers  to the appropriate function(s) within the RE’s 
three lines of defence, which are (i) business unit management; (ii) an independent 
Operational Risk Management  including Compliance fun ction; and (iii) audit function.  
2.13 “ Risk appetite” is the aggregate level and types of risk an RE is willing to 
assume, decided in advance and within its risk capacity, to achieve its strategic objectives and business plan.
7 
2.14 “Risk tolerance”  is the variation around the prescribed risk appetite that the 
RE is willing to tolerate.  
2.15 “Supervisory  Authority ” means,  
2.15.1  Reserve Bank of India in case of Commercial Banks (including Local Area 
Banks, Payments Banks, Small Finance Banks, and Primary Urban Co-operative 
Banks), Non- Banking Financial Companies, and All India Financial Institutions.  
2.15.2 National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development  (NABARD) in case of 
State Co -operative Bank s, Central Co -operative Banks, and Regional Rural Banks.  
2.15.3  National Housing Bank ( NHB) in case of Housing Finance Companies . 
2.16 “Tolerance for disruption or Impact Tolerance” is the level of disruption 
from any type of Operational Risk  an RE is willing to accept given a range of severe 
but plausible scenarios .  
PILLAR I: Prepare and Protect  
 
3.  Three lines of defence for management of Operational Risk 
3.1 Sound internal governance forms the foundation of an effective ORMF. The 
Operational Risk  governance function of REs should be fully integrated into their 
overall risk management governance structure. REs may leverage their existing risk 
management functions for this purpose.  
 
 
                                                            
7 “Risk appetite” is defined in BCBS’s 2015 Corporate governance guidelines, which use the FSB’s 2013 Principles for an 
effective risk appetite framework.  
8 
 3.2  As a part of their ORMF, REs shall rely on three lines of defence:  
 
 
  
 
   
 3.2.1  First line of Defence  
3.2.1.1  Business Unit  Management typically forms the first line of defence. Sound 
Operational Risk  governance recognises that business unit management is 
responsible for identifying and managing the risks inherent in the products,  services, 
activities, processes and systems fo r which it is accountable. REs should have a 
policy that defines clear roles and responsibilities of  relevant business units. The 
responsibilities of an effective first line of defence in promoting a sound Operational 
Risk Management  culture should include: 
(i) Identifying and assessing the materiality of Operational Risks inherent in their 
respective business units through the use of Operational Risk Management  
tools;  
(ii) Establishing appropriate controls to mitigate inherent Operational Risks, and 
assessing the design and effectiveness of these controls through the use of the Operational Risk Management  tools;  
(iii) Reporting whether the business units lack adequate resources, tools and training 
to ensure identification and assessment of Operational Risk s; 
(iv) Monitoring and reporting the business units’ Operational Risk  profiles,  and 
ensuring their adherence to the established Operational Risk  appetite and 
tolerance statement; and Audit Function  (Third 
Line of Defence) Organisational Operation al 
Risk Management Funct ion 
including  Compliance 
Function (Second Line of 
Defence)  Business Unit 
Management 
(First Line of 
Defence)  
9 
 (v) Reporting residual Operational Risk s not mitigated by controls, including 
operational loss ev ents, control deficiencies, process inadequacies, and non-
compliance with Operational Risk  tolerances.  
 
3.2.2  Second line of defence  
3.2.2.1  A functionally independent Organisational Operational Risk Management 
Function (OORF)  forms the second line of defence. The responsibilities of an 
effective second line of defence in promoting a sound Operational Risk Management  
culture should include:  
(i) Developing an independent v iew regarding business units’ (a) identified material 
Operational Risk s, (b ) design and effecti veness of key controls, and (c ) risk 
tolerance;  
(ii) Challenging the relevance and consistency of the business unit’s implementation 
of the Operational Risk Management  tools, measurement activities and reporting 
systems, and providing evidence of this eff ective challenge;  
(iii) Developing and maintaining Operational Risk Management  and measurement 
policies, standards and guidelines;  
(iv) Reviewing and contributing to the monitoring and reporting of the Operational 
Risk profile; and 
(v) Designing and providing Operational  Risk training and instilling risk awareness . 
3.2.2.2 At smaller  REs (i.e., NBFC- Base Layer and Tier 1  & 2 Co -operative 
Banks  for the purpose of this Guidance Note) , if functions of both first and second 
line of defence are carried out by the same unit, in dependence may be achieved 
through separation of duties  (with documented policies and processes emphasizing 
the same)  and an independent review of processes and functions. In larger REs (i.e., 
REs other than the smaller REs ), the O ORF should have a reporti ng structure 
independent of the risk -generating business units and be responsible for the design, 
maintenance and ongoing development of the ORMF within the RE. The O ORF 
typically engages relev ant corporate control groups ( e.g., Legal, Finance and IT) as 
well as the  overall Risk Management Function of the RE,  to support its assessment 
of the Operational Risk s and controls. REs should have a policy which clearly 
defines the roles and responsibilities of the O ORF, reflective of the size and 
complexity of the organisation.  
 
10 
 3.2.2.3 In addition to the independent ORMF, the second line of defence also 
typically includes the compliance function.  
 
3.2.3  Third line of defence  
The third line of defence, i.e the audit function provides an independent assurance to 
the Board regarding the appropriateness of RE’s ORMF.  This function’s staff should 
not be involved in the development, implementation and operation of Operational 
Risk Management  processes which has been carried out by the other two lines of 
defence. The thi rd line of defence reviews are generally carried out by RE’s internal 
and/or external audit but may also involve suitably qualified independent third parties. The scope and frequency of reviews should not only be sufficient to cover all 
activities and legal entities of a n RE, aligned with the RE's Operational Risk profile,  
and identify and prioritize key risk areas that warrant thorough examination but also
 
be responsive to the dynamic nature of the Operational Risk environment.  An 
effective independent rev iew includes two processes : 
3.2.3.1 Validation 
Ensuring  that the quantification systems used by the RE are sufficiently robust as (i) 
they provide assurance about  the integrity of inputs, assumptions, processes and 
methodologies  and (ii) result s in assessment of Operational Risk  that credibly 
reflect s the Operational Risk  profile of the RE;  
 
3.2.3.2  Verification  
(i) Review of the design and implementation of the Operational Risk Management  
systems (including compliance and consistency with Board policies)  and 
associat ed governance processes through the first and second lines of defence 
(including the independence of the second line of defence);  
(ii) Review of validation processes to ensure they are independent and implemented 
in a manner consistent with established RE policies; 
(iii) Ensuring that business units’ management promptly, accurately and adequately 
responds to the issues raised, and regularly reports to the B oard of D irectors or 
its relevant C ommittees on pending and closed issues;  
(iv) Identifying gaps, if any, in the ORMF and reporting to the Board or its relevant 
Committee ; and 
11 
 (v) Providing opinion on the overall adequacy and appropriateness of the ORMF 
and the associated governance processes across the RE by assessing  whether 
the ORMF meets organisational needs and expectat ions (such as  in respect of 
the risk appetite and tolerance, and adjustment of the framework to changing 
circumstances)  and complies with statutory and legislative provisions, 
contractual arrangements, internal rules and ethical conduct.  
 3.3 REs should ensure that each line of defence:  
3.3.1 has clearly defined roles and responsibilities;  
3.3.2 is adequately resourced in terms of budget, tools and staff;  
3.3.3 is continuously and adequately trained;  
3.3.4 promotes a sound operational risk management cultur e across the 
organisation; and  
3.3.5 communicates with the other lines of defence to reinforce the ORMF.  
3.4 The seamless collaboration between these lines of defence can form a 
formidable shield, safeguarding not only individual REs but the entire financ ial 
system against potential threats and vulnerabilities.  
4. Governance and Risk Culture 
Principle  1- The Board of Directors should take the lead in establishing a 
strong risk management culture, implemented by Senior Management. The 
Board of Directors and Senior Management should establish a corporate 
culture guided by strong risk management, set standards and incentives for 
professional and responsible behaviour, and ensure that staff receives 
appropriate risk management and ethics training.  
4.1 REs with  a strong culture of risk management and ethical business practices 
are less likely to experience damaging Operational Risk  events and are better placed 
to effectively deal with those events that  occur . The actions of the B oard of D irectors 
and Senior Management as well as the RE ’s risk management policies, processes 
and systems provide the foundation for a sound risk management culture.  
4.2 The Board of D irectors should establish a code of conduct or an ethics policy 
to address conduct risk. This code or policy should be applicable to both staff and 
Board members . It should set clear expectations for integrity and ethical values of 
the highest standard, identify acceptable business practices, and prohibit conflicts of 
interest or the inappropriate provision of financial services (whether wilful or 
12 
 negligent). It should be regularly reviewed and approved by the Board of D irectors 
and attested by employees . Its implementation should be overseen by a senior 
ethics committee, or another B oard- level committee, a nd should be publicly availabl e 
(e.g., on the RE’s website , branch premises ). A separate code of conduct may be 
established for specific positions in the RE ( e.g., treasury dealers  etc.).  
 
4.3 Senior Management should set clear expectations and define accountabilities  
to ensure RE’s  staff understand their roles and responsibilities of  risk management, 
as well as their authority to act.  
4.4 Compensation policies should be aligned to the RE’s statement of risk 
appetite and tolerance as well as overall soundness  of risk management framework , 
and appropriately balance risk and reward.  Inappropriate incentives may result in 
increased litigation, reputational risk, or other risks to the RE. Therefore, the RE 
should review whether its existing governance and cont rols are adequate in light of 
risks arising from incentive arrangements . 
4.5 Senior Management should ensure that an appropriate level of Operational 
Risk training is available at all levels throughout the organisation, such as heads of 
business units, heads of internal controls and senior managers. Training provided 
should reflect the seniority, role and responsibilities of the individuals for whom it is 
intended.  It should also appropriately include ethics training.  
13 
 4.6 Strong and consistent support of the Board of Directors and Senior 
Management for operational risk management coupled with ethical behaviour 
convincingly reinforces codes of conduct and ethics , compensation strategies , etc.  
Principle  2- REs should develop, implement and maintain an ORMF  that is fully 
integrated into the RE’s overall risk management processes. The ORMF 
adopted by an individual RE will depend on a range of factors, including its 
nature, size, complexity and risk profile. Further, REs should utilize their 
existing governance structure to establish, oversee and implement an effective 
operational resilience approach that enables them to respond and adapt to, as 
well as recover and learn from, disruptive events in order to minimise their 
impact on delivering critical operations th rough disruption . 
4.7 The Board of D irectors and Senior M anagement of RE should understand the 
nature and complexity of the risks inherent in the portfolio of RE’s  new business 
initiatives, products, services, activities, processes, and systems, which is a 
fundamental premise of sound risk management. This is particularly important for 
Operational Risk , as it is inherent in all business products, services, activities, 
processes , and systems.  
 
4.8 The components of the ORMF should be fully integrated into the overall risk 
management processes of the RE by the first line of defence, adequately challenged 
and reviewed by the second line of defence, and independently reviewed by the third 
line of defence. The ORMF should be embedded across all levels of the RE  
14 
 including group and business units as well as new business initiatives , products, 
services, activities, processes , and systems. In addition, results of the RE’s 
Operational Risk  assessment should be incorporated into the RE’s overall business 
strategy dev elopment process.  The overall approach to ORMF should reflect the  
following:  
4.8.1 Management of Operational Risk is embedded within business lines of an RE.  
4.8.2 Senior managers are responsible for management and ownership of 
Operational Risk across RE’s  end-to-end processes.  
4.8.3 Board is ultimately responsible and accountable for oversight of Operational 
Risk Management.  
4.9 The ORMF should be comprehensively and appropriately documented in 
Board of D irectors approved policies and include definitions of Operational Risk  and 
operational loss.  If REs do not adequately describe and classify Operational Risk  
and loss exposure, it would  result in significantly reduc ing the effectiveness of their 
ORMF.  
4.10 ORMF documentation should clearly:  
4.10.1  identify the governance structures used to manage Operational Risk , 
including reporting lines and accountabilities, and the mandates and membership of 
the Operational Risk  governance committees;  
4.10.2  reference the relevant Operational Risk Management  policies and 
procedures;  
4.10.3  describe the tools for risk and control identification and assessment and the 
role and responsibilities of the three lines of defence in using them;  
4.10.4  describe the RE’s accepted Operational Risk  appetite and tolerance; the 
thresholds, material activity triggers or limits for inherent and residual risk; and the 
approved risk mitigation strategies and instruments;  
4.10.5  describe the RE’s approach to ensure controls are designed, implemented 
and operat e effectively;  
4.10.6  describe t he RE’s approach to establishing and monitoring thresholds or 
limits for inherent and residual risk exposure;  
15 
 4.10.7  describe inventory risks and controls implemented by all business units ( e.g., 
in a control library);  
4.10.8  establish risk reporting and management information systems (MIS) for 
producing timely, and accurate data;  
4.10.9  provide for a common taxonomy of Operational Risk  terms to ensure 
consistency of risk identification, exposure rating and risk management objectives 
across all business units. The taxonomy can distinguish Operational Risk  exposures 
by event types, causes, materiality and business units where they occur; it can also 
flag those operational risk exposures that partially or entirely represent legal, 
conduct, model and ICT (including cyber) risks as well as exposures in the credit or 
market risk boundary;  
4.10.10 provide for appropriate independent review and challenge of the outcomes 
of the risk management process; and 
4.10.11 require the policies to be reviewed and revised as  appropriate based on 
continued assessment of the quality of the control environment addressing internal 
and external environmental changes or whenever a material change in the 
Operational Risk  profile of the RE occurs.  
5. Responsibilities of Board of Directors and Senior Management  
Principle  3- The Board of Directors should approve and periodically review the 
ORMF and Operational Resilience approach, and ensure that Senior 
Management implements the policies, processes and systems of the ORMF 
and Operationa l Resilience approach effectively at all decision levels.  
5.1 The Board of D irectors should:  
5.1.1 establish a risk management culture and ensure that the RE has adequate 
processes for understanding the nature and scope of the Operational Risk  inherent 
in its current and planned strategies and activities;  
5.1.2 ensure that the Operational Risk Management  processes are subject to 
comprehensive and dynamic oversight and are fully integrated into, or coordinated with, the overall framework for managing all ri sks across the enterprise;  
5.1.3 provide senior management with clear guidance regarding the principles 
underlying the ORMF, and approve the corresponding policies developed by senior management to align with these principles;  
16 
 5.1.4 regularly review and e valuate the effectiveness of, and approve the ORMF to 
ensure the RE has identified and is managing the Operational Risk  arising from 
external market changes and other environmental factors, as well as those 
Operational Risk s associated with new products, services, activities, processes or 
systems, including changes in risk profiles and priorities (e.g. changing business volumes);  
5.1.5 ensure that the RE’s ORMF is subject to effective independent review by a 
third line of defence (audit or other appropriately trained independent third parties from external sources);  and 
5.1.6 ensure that, as best practices evolve, management is availing themselves of 
these advances . 
5.2 Strong internal controls are a critical aspect of Operational Risk Management . 
The Board of Directors should establish clear lines of management responsibility and 
accountability for implementing a strong control environment. Controls should be regularly reviewed, monitored, and tested to ensure its ongoing effectiveness. The 
control environment should provide appropriate independence/separation of duties 
between Operational Risk Management  functions, business units and support 
functions .  
5.3  The Board of D irectors should review and approve the RE’s Operational 
Resilience approach considering the RE’s risk appetite and tolerance for disruption 
to its critical operations. In formulating the RE’s tolerance for disruption, the Board of Directors should consider its operational capabilities given a broad range of severe 
but plausible scenarios that would affec t its critical operations. The B oard of 
Directors should ensure that the RE’s policies effectively address instances where 
the RE’s capabilities are insufficient to meet its stated tolerance for disruption.  
5.4 The Board of D irectors should take an active role in establishing a broad 
understanding of the RE’s operational resilience approach, through clear communication of its objectives to all relevant parties, including the RE’s personnel, third parties, and intragroup entities.   
5.5  Under the oversight of the Board of D irectors, Senior Management should 
implement the RE’s operational resilience approach and ensure that financial, 
17 
 technical, and other resources are appropriately allocated in order to support the 
RE’s overall operational resili ence approach.  
Principle  4- The Board of Directors should approve and periodically review a 
risk appetite and tolerance statement for Operational Risk that articulates the 
nature, types and levels of Operational Risk the RE  is willing to assume. The 
Board of Directors should also review and approve the criteria for 
identification and classification as critical operations as well as of impact 
tolerances for each critical operation , in order to enhance RE’s Operational 
Resilience.  
 
5.6 The risk appetite and tolerance statement for Operational Risk  should be 
developed under the authority of the B oard of Directors and linked to the RE ’s short 
and long- term strategic and financial plans. Taking into account the interests of the 
RE’s customers and stakeholders  as well as regulatory requirements, an effective 
risk appetite and tolerance statement should:   
5.6.1 be easy to communicate and easy to understand for all stakeholders;  
5.6.2 include key background information and assumptions that informed the RE’s 
busines s plans at the time of its approval ; 
5.6.3 include statements that clearly articulate the motivation( s) for taking on or 
avoiding certain types of risk, and establish boundaries or indicators (which may be 
quantitative or not) to enable monitoring of these risks;  
5.6.4 ensure that the strategy and risk limits of business units and legal entities, as 
relevant, align with the RE- wide risk appetite statement; and 
18 
 5.6.5 be forward -looking and, where applicable, subject to scenario and stress 
testing to ensure t hat the RE understands what events might push it outside its risk 
appetite and tolerance statement . 
5.7 The starting point for an RE in enhancing its operational resilience is to set the 
criteria for defining its critical operations. The B oard of D irectors  should approve 
clearly defined and documented criteria to determine how operations are classified 
as critical. The criteria should enable an RE to identify its critical operations and prioritise them in the event of a disruption. This should be achieved by considering the risk a disruption poses to its customers, the RE’s viability, safety and soundness, 
and overall financial stability. The criteria for the identification of critical operations should be reviewed and approved by the B oard annually or at the time of 
implementing material changes to the business that would involve additional critical operations.  
5.8 The Board of D irectors should review and approve impact tolerances for each 
critical operation at least annually or as and when a disruption occurs. The purpose of impact tolerance is to quantify the maximum acceptable level of disruption for 
each critical operation. It  needs to be tested against severe but plausible scenarios 
to determine their appropriateness , i.e., to determine whether the RE is  able to stay 
within the defined impact tolerances during a disruption.  
5.9 An RE should set at least one impact tolerance metric for each of its critical 
operations. At a minimum, there should be a (a) time-based metric ( e.g., maximum 
acceptable duration a critical operation can withstand a disruption) , (b) quantity -
based metric ( e.g., maximum extent of data loss that an RE would accept as a result 
of disruption)  and (c) service level metric ( e.g., minimum level of service that an RE 
would maintain while operating under alternative arrangements. ) To further enhance 
its operational resilience, an RE should consider having additional impact tolerance 
metrics such as  the maximum tolerable number of customers affected by a 
disruption; maximum number of transac tions affected by a disruption; and the 
maximum value of transactions impacted.  
 
 
 
19 
 Principle  5- Senior Management should develop for approval by the Board of 
Directors a clear, effective and robust governance structure with well -defined, 
transparent and c onsistent lines of responsibility. Senior Management is 
responsible for consistently implementing and maintaining throughout the 
organisation policies, processes and systems for managing Operational Risk 
in all of the RE’s material products, activities, pr ocesses and systems 
consistent with its risk appetite and tolerance statement.  
5.10 Senior Management should translate the ORMF approved by the B oard of 
Directors into specific policies and procedures that can be implemented and verified 
within the differ ent business units. It  should clearly assign authority, responsibility 
and reporting relationships to encourage and maintain accountability, and to ensure 
the necessary resources are available to manage Operational Risk  in line with the 
RE’s risk appetite and tolerance statement. Moreover, it should also ensure that the 
management oversight process is appropriate for the risks inherent in a business 
unit’s activity.  
5.11 Senior Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining robust 
challenge mechanisms and effective issue resolution processes. These should include systems to report, track , and when necessary, escalate issues to ensure 
resolution. REs should be able to demonstrate that the three- lines-of-defence 
approach is operating satisfactorily  and to explain how the B oard of D irectors, 
independent Audit Committee of the Board, and Senior Management ensure that this 
approach is implemented and operating in an appropriate manner . 
5.12 Senior Management should ensure that staff responsible for managing 
Operational Risk  co-ordinate and communicate effectively with staff responsible for 
managing credit, market, and other risks, as well as with those in the RE who are 
responsible for the procurement of external services such as insurance risk transfer  
and other third- party arrangements. Failure to do so could result in significant gaps 
or overlaps in an  RE’s overall risk management programme.  
5.13 The managers of the O ORF within the RE should be of sufficient stature to 
perform their duties effectively , ideally evidenced by a title that is commensurate with 
other risk management functions such as credit, market and liquidity risk.  
5.14 Senior Management should ensure that RE’s  activities are conducted by staff 
with the necessary experience, technical capabilities and access to resources. The 
20 
 staff responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the RE’s risk policy 
should have authority independent from the units they oversee.  
5.15 An RE’s governance structure should be commensurate with the nat ure, size, 
complexity and risk profile of its activities. When designing the Operational Risk  
governance structure, an  RE should take the following into consideration:  
5.15.1 Committee structure –  A sound industry practice for larger and more complex 
organisations with a central group function and separate business units  to utilise a 
Board- created enterprise- level risk committee for overseeing all risks, to which a 
management level Operational Risk  Committee reports. Depending on the nature, 
size and comple xity of the RE, the enterprise- level risk committee may receive input 
from Operational Risk  committee (s), business or functional area. Smaller and less 
complex organisations may utilise a flatter organisational structure that oversees Operational Risk  directly within the Board’s risk management committee.  
5.15.2 Committee composition –  A sound industry practice for Operational Risk  
committees (or the risk committee in smaller REs) is to include members with a 
variety of expertise, which should cover experti se in business activities, financial 
activities, legal, technological and regulatory matters, and risk management.   
5.15.3 Committee operation –  Committee meetings should be held at appropriate 
frequencies with adequate time and resources to permit product ive discussion and 
decision- making. Records of committee operations should be adequate and 
documented to permit review and evaluation of committee effectiveness . 
5.16 Because Operational Risk Management  is an evolving  area, and the business 
environment is constantly changing, S enior Management should ensure that the 
RE’s policies, processes and systems  under ORMF remain sufficiently robust to 
manage and ensure that operational losses are adequately addressed in a timely manner. Improvements in Operational R isk Management  depend heavily on senior 
management’s willingness to be proactive and also act promptly and appropriately to address Operational Risk  managers’ concerns.  
 
 
 
21 
 6. Risk management environment - Identification and assessment  
Principle 6 : Senior M anagement should ensure the comprehensive 
identification and assessment of the Operational Risk inherent in all material 
products, activities, processes and systems to make sure the inherent risks 
and incentives are well understood. Both internal and exter nal threats and 
potential failures in people, processes and systems should be assessed 
promptly and on an ongoing basis. Assessment of vulnerabilities in critical 
operations should be done in a proactive and prompt manner. All the resulting 
risks should be  managed in accordance with operational resilience approach.  
6.1 Risk identification and assessment are fundamental characteristics of an 
effective Operational Risk Management  system, and directly contribute to 
operational resilience capabilities. Effecti ve risk identification considers both internal 
and external factors . Sound risk assessment allows an RE to better understand its 
risk profile and allocate risk management resources and strategies most effectively.  
For example, figure below  shows  the wide s pectrum  of risks (risk universe) which 
could be existing in third-party  relationships.  
 
6.2 Examples of tools (indicative and not exhaustive) used for identifying and 
assessing Operational Risk  are: 
 
 
 
22 
 
 
6.2.1 Self-assessments – REs often perform self -assessments of their Operational 
Risks and controls at various levels. The assessments typically evaluate inherent 
risk (the risk before controls are considered), the effectiveness of the control environment, and residual risk (the risk exposure after control s are considered) and 
contain both quantitative (such as metrics, benchmarking, etc. ) and qualitative (such 
as likelihood and consequence of the risk event in determination of inherent and residual risk ratings) elements. The assessments may utilise business process mapping to identify key steps in business processes, activities, and organisational functions, as well as the associated risks and areas of control weakness. The 
assessments should contain sufficiently detailed information on the business 
environment, Operational Risks, underlying causes, controls and evaluation of 
control effectiveness to enable an independent reviewer to determine how the RE 
reached its ratings. A risk register can be maintained to collate this information to form a meaningful view of the overall effectiveness of controls and facilitate oversight 
by senior management, risk committees, and the Board of Directors .  
6.2.2 Operational Risk  event data – REs often maintain a comprehensive 
Operational Risk  event dataset that collects all material events experienced by the 
RE and serves as basis for Operational Risk  assessments. The event dataset 
typically includes internal loss data, near misses , etc., and is  classified according to 
a taxonomy defined in the ORMF policies and consistent ly applied across the RE. It 
also includes the date of the event (oc currence date, discover y date and accounting 
date) and, in the case of loss events, financial impact. When other root cause 
information for events is available, ideally it can also be incl uded in the Operational 
23 
 Risk dataset. Where feasible, RE s are encour aged to also seek to gather external 
Operational Risk  event data and use this data in their internal analysis, as it is often 
informative of risks that are common across the industry.  
6.2.3 Event management –  A sound event management approach typically includes 
analysis of events to identify new Operational Risk s, understanding the underlying 
causes and control weaknesses, and formulating an appropriate response to prevent 
recurrence of sim ilar events. This information is an input to the self -assessment and, 
in particular, to the assessment of control effectiveness.   
6.2.4 Control monitoring and assurance framework –  Incorporating an appropriate 
control monitoring and assurance framework fac ilitates a structured approach to the 
evaluation, review and ongoing monitoring and testing of key controls. The analysis of controls ensures these are suitably designed for the identified risks and are 
operating effectively. The analysis should also consi der the sufficiency of control 
coverage, including adequate prevention, detection and response strategies. The control monitoring and testing should be appropriate for the different Operational Risks and across business areas.  Further details on control and mitigation are given 
in paragraph 9 of this  Guidance Note.  
6.2.5 Metrics – Using Operational Risk  event data and risk and control 
assessments, REs often develop metrics to assess and monitor their Operational 
Risk exposure. These metrics may be simple in dicators, such as event counts, or 
result from more sophisticated exposure models. Metrics provide early warning information to monitor ongoing performance of the business and the control environment, and to report the Operational Risk  profile. Effective metrics clearly link  
the associated Operational Risk s and controls. Monitoring metrics and related trends 
through time against laid down thresholds or limits  or tolerance levels  provides 
valuable information for risk management and reporting purposes.  
6.2.6 Scenario analysis  – Scenario analysis is a method to identify, measure and 
analyse a range of scenarios, including low probability and high severity events, some of which could result in severe Operational Risk  losses. It typically involves 
workshops or  meetings of subject matter experts including senior management, 
business management and senior Operational Risk  staff and other functional areas 
such as compliance, human resources and IT risk management, to develop and analyse the drivers and range of cons equences of potential events. Inputs to the 
24 
 scenario analysis would typically include relevant internal and external loss data, 
information from self -assessments, the control monitoring and assurance framework, 
forward -looking metrics, root -cause analyses and the process framework . The 
scenario analysis process could be used to develop a range of consequences of potential events, including impact assessments for risk management purposes, supplementing other tools based on historical data or current risk ass essments. An 
RE must carry out regular scenario analysis using the above parameters, for testing 
its ability to remain within its impact tolerance in the event disruption of its operations , for each of its critical services.  In carrying out the scenario analysis , an 
RE must identify the range of adverse circumstances of varying nature, severity and 
duration,  relevant to its business and risk profile and consider the risks to delivery of 
the RE’s critical services in those circumstances . Such an exercise could also be 
integrated with disaster recovery and business continuity plans, for further  testing of 
operational resilience. Given the subjectivity of the scenario process, a robust governance framework and independent review are important to ensure the integrity and consistency of the process.   
6.2.7 Benchmarking and comparative analysis –  Benchmarking and comparative 
analysis are comparisons of the outcomes of different risk measurement and management tools deployed within the RE, as well as comparisons of metrics of the 
RE, with other REs in the industry. Such comparisons can be performed to enhance 
understanding of the RE’s Operational Risk  profile. For example, comparing the 
frequency and severity of internal losses with self -assessments can help the RE  
determine whether its self -assessment processes are functioning effectively. 
Scenario analysis  data can be compared with  internal and external loss data to gain 
a better understanding of the severity of the RE’s exposure to potential risk events . 
6.3 REs sh ould ensure that the Operational Risk  assessment tools’ outputs are:  
6.3.1 based on accurate data, whose integrity is ensured by strong governance and 
robust verification and validation procedures;  
6.3.2 adequately tak ing into account the internal pricing and performance 
measurement mechanisms as well as business  opportunities assessments; and  
6.3.3 subject to O ORF -monitored action plans or remediation plans when 
necessary . 
25 
 6.4 These Operational Risk  assessment tools directly contribute to an  RE’s 
operational resilience approach, in particular event management, self -assessment 
and scenario analysis procedures, as they allow REs to identify and monitor  both 
internal and external  threats and vulnerabilities to their critical operations. REs 
should use the outputs of these tools on a regular basis and in a timely manner to 
manage, address and improve their operational resilience controls and procedures 
so as to prevent them from affecting critical operations delivery. In doing so, the 
Operational Risk Management  function should work alongside other relevant 
functions. These assessments should also be conducted in the event of changes to 
any underlying components of the critical operations, as well as after incidents in order to take into account lessons learned and new threats and vulnerabilities , if any,  
that caused the incident . 
7. Change Management  
Principle 7 : Senior Management should ensure that the RE’s change 
management process is comprehensive, appropriately resourced and 
adequately articulated between the  relevant lines of defence.  
7.1 In general, an  RE’s Operational Risk  exposure evolves when an  RE initiates 
change, such as engaging in new activities or developing new products or services; entering into unfamiliar markets or jurisdictions; implementing new or modifying business processes or technology systems; and/or engaging in businesses that are geographically distant from the Head Office. Change management should assess 
the evolution of associated risks across time, from inception to termination (e.g.  
throughout the full life cycle of a product
8). 
7.2 An RE should have policies and procedures defining the process for 
identifying, managing, challenging, approving and monitoring change on the basis of agreed objective criteria. Change implementation should be monitored by specific 
oversight controls. Change management policies and procedures should be subject 
to independent and regular review and update, and clearly allocate roles and 
responsibilities in accordance with the three- lines-of-defence model, i n particular:  
7.2.1 The first line of defence should perform Operational Risk  and control 
assessments of new products,  services,  activities, processes and systems, including 
the identification and evaluation of the required change through the decision- maki ng 
                                                            
8 The life cycle of a product or service encompasses various stages from the development, ongoing changes, grandfathering 
and closure. Indeed, the level of risk may escalate for example when new products, services, activities, processes, or systems 
transition from an introductory level to a level that represents material sources of revenue or business -critical operations.  
26 
 and planning phases to the implementation of the change and post -implementation 
review.   
7.2.2 The second line of defence ( OORF) should challenge the Operational Risk  
and control assessments of first line of defence, as well as monitor the 
implementation of appropriate controls or remediation actions. O ORF should cover 
all phases of this process. In addition, O ORF should ensure that all relevant control 
groups ( e.g., finance, compliance, legal, business, ICT, risk management) are 
involved as appropriate.  
7.2.3 The third line of defence may review the above as per the mandate defined at 
paragraph 3.2.3.  
7.3 As a part of the change management exercise, an RE should have policies 
and procedures for the review and approval of new products, services, activities, 
processes , and systems. The review and approval process should consider:  
7.3.1 Inherent risks –  including legal, ICT , and model  risks – in the launch of new 
products, services, activities, and operations in unfamiliar markets, and in the implementation of new processes, people and systems (especially when third party 
services are used). 
7.3.2 Changes to the RE’s Operational Risk  profile, appetite and tolerance, 
including changes to the risk of existing products or activities , especially critical 
operati ons. 
7.3.3 The necessary controls, risk management processes, and risk mitigation 
strategies.  
7.3.4 The residual risk.  
7.3.5 Changes to relevant risk thresholds or limits.  
7.3.6 The procedures and metrics to assess, monitor, and manage the risk of new 
products, services, activities, markets, jurisdictions, processes and systems.  
7.4 The review and approval process should include ensuring that appropriate 
investment has been made for human resources and technology infrastructure 
before changes are introduced. Changes should be monitored, during and after their 
implementation, to identify any material differences to the expected Operational Risk  
profile and manage any unexpected risks.  
27 
 7.5 REs should maintain a central record of their products and services to the 
extent possible (including the third -party arrangements) to facilitate the monitoring of 
changes.  
7.6  REs should leverage change management capabilities in accordance with the 
change management processes as a way to assess potential effects on the del ivery 
of critical operations and their interconnections and interdependencies for ensuring 
operational resilience.  
8. Monitoring and Reporting  
Principle 8 : Senior Management should implement a process to regularly 
monitor Operational Risk profiles and mate rial operational exposures. 
Appropriate reporting mechanisms should be in place at the Board of 
Directors, Senior Management, and business unit levels to support proactive 
management of Operational Risk.  
8.1 An RE should ensure that its reports are comprehensive, accurate, consistent 
and actionable across business units and products. To this end, the first line of defence should ensure reporting on any residual Operational Risk s, including 
Operational Risk  events, control deficiencies, process inadequacies, and non-
compliance with Operational Risk  tolerances. Reports should be manageable in 
scope and volume by providing an outlook on the RE’s Operational Risk  profile and 
adherence to the Operational Risk  appetite and tolerance statement; effective 
decision- making is impeded by both excessive amounts and paucity of data.  
8.2 Reporting by RE should be timely and should be able to produce reports in 
both normal and stressed market conditions.
9 The frequency of reporting should 
reflect the risks involved and the pace and nature of changes in the operating 
environment. The results of monitoring activities should be incl uded in regular 
management and Board reports, as should assessments of the ORMF performed by the internal/external audit and/or risk management functions.  Reports generated by 
or for supervisory authorities should also be reported internally to S enior 
Management and the Board of D irectors . 
8.3 Operational Risk  reports should describe the Operational Risk  profile of the 
RE by providing internal financial, operational, and compliance indicators, as well as 
                                                            
9 Reporting should be consistent with BCBS’ Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting 
(https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs239.pdf).  
28 
 external market or environmental information about events and conditions that are 
relevant to decision making.  
 
8.4 Data capture and risk reporting processes should be analysed periodically 
with the  goal of enhancing risk management performance as well as advancing risk 
management policies, procedures and practices.  
8.5 Further, Senior Management should provide timely reports to the Board on the 
ongoing operational resilience of the RE’s business uni ts to support the B oard’s 
oversight, particularly when significant deficiencies could affect the delivery of the RE’s critical operations.  
9. Control and Mitigation 
Principle 9 : REs should have a strong control environment that utilises 
policies, processes  and systems; appropriate internal controls; and 
appropriate risk mitigation and/or transfer strategies.  
9.1 Internal controls should be designed to provide reasonable assurance that a n 
RE will have efficient and effective operations; safeguard its assets ; produce reliable 
financial reports; and comply with applicable laws and regulations. A sound internal control programme consists of four components that are integral to the risk management process: risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring activities.
10 
                                                            
10 BCBS paper on “ Framework for Internal Control Systems in Banking Organisations, September 1998 ” discusses internal 
contr ols in greater detail.  
29 
 9.2 Control processes and procedures should include a system for ensuring 
compliance with policies, regulations and laws. Examples of principal  elements of a 
policy compliance assessment are:  
Examples of principal el ements of a policy compliance assessment are:  
• Top-level reviews of progress towards stated objectives  
• Verification of compliance with management controls  
• Review of the treatment and resolution of instances of non -compliance  
• Evaluation of the require d approvals and authorisations to ensure accountability 
to an appropriate level of management  
• Tracking of reports for approved exceptions to thresholds or limits, 
management overrides and other deviations from policy, regulations and laws  
9.3 Controls processes and procedures should address how the RE ensures 
continuity of operations in both normal circumstances and in the event of disruption, 
reflecting respective functions’ due diligence, consistent with the RE’s operational resilience approach.  
9.4 An effective control environment also requires appropriate segregation of 
duties. Assignments that establish conflicting duties for individuals or a team, without dual contr ols { e.g., a process that uses two or more separate entities (usually 
persons) operating in concert to protect sensitive functions or information}  or other 
countermeasures, may result in concealment of losses, errors or other inappropriate actions. Therefore, areas where conflicts of interest may arise should be identified, minimised, and be subject to careful monitoring and review.  
9.5 In addition to segregation of duties and dual controls, REs should ensure that 
other traditional internal controls are in place, as appropriate, to address Operational Risk. Some of the examples of these controls are given in table below : 
30 
 
 
9.6 Effective use and sound implementation of technology can contribute to the 
control environment. For example, automated processes are less prone to error than 
manual processes. However, automated processes introduce risk s that should be 
addressed through sound technology governance and infrastructure risk management programmes.  
9.7 The use of technology related products,  services,  activities, processes and 
delivery channels exposes an  RE to Operational Risk  and the possibility of material 
financial loss. Consequently, an  RE should have an integrated approach to 
identifying, measuring, monitoring and managing technology risks along the same 
precepts as Operational Risk Management . (Also refer to paragraph 15 of this  
Guidanc e Note)  
9.8 While recourse to entities such as, but not limited to third- party service 
providers can help manage costs, provide expertise, expand product offerings, and 
improve services, it also introduces risks that RE should address. The integrated 
approach adopted by RE for its ORMF should necessarily include such third- party 
dependencies. Amongst others, the concentration of risk , complexity and 
downstream dependencies with regard to third- party service providers  should be 
taken into account. While thes e risks may be unavoidable, identifying and monitoring 
of such risks would allow REs to initiate actions that could reasonably mitigate or  
manage them. These risk policies and risk management activities should include 
31 
 critical operations management and dependency management. (Also refer to 
paragraph 12 of this Guidance Note)  
9.9 In those circumstances where internal controls do not adequately address risk 
and exiting  the risk is not a reasonable option, management may  complement 
controls by seeking to transfer the risk to another party such as through insurance. 
The Board of D irectors should determine the maximum loss exposure the RE is 
willing to take and has the financial capacity to assume and should perform an 
annual review of the RE's risk and insurance management programme, including 
specific insurance or risk transfer needs of an RE. 
9.10 Because risk transfer is an imperfect substitute for sound controls and risk 
management programmes, REs should view risk transfer tools as complementary to, rather t han a replacement for  internal Operational Risk  control s. Having mechanisms 
in place to quickly identify, recognise and rectify distinct Operational Risk  errors can 
greatly reduce exposures.  Careful consideration also needs to be given to the extent 
to which risk mitigation tools such as insurance truly reduce risk, transfer the risk to another business sector or area, or create a new risk (e.g., counterparty risk, legal risk). 
Pillar 2: Build Resilience  
 
10 Essential Elements of Operational Resilience  
10.1 Operational resilience is an outcome that benefits from the effective 
management of Operational Risk . Activities such as risk identification and 
assessment, risk mitigation (including the implementation of controls) and the monitoring of risks and control  effectiveness work together to minimise operational 
disruptions and their effects.  The overarching principle of operational resilience is the 
acceptance that disruptions will occur, and that REs need to be prepared to respond 
accordingly and have measur es in place to limit the impact . The REs need to ensure 
that they have prepared effectively, and have the flexibility to withstand, absorb, respond, adapt and recover and learn from disruptions with minimal impact on their 
critical operations.  Further , management’s focus on the RE’s ability to respond to 
and recover from disruptions, assuming failures will occur, will support operational 
resilience. An operationally resilient RE is less prone to incur untimely lapses in its 
operations and losses from disruptions, thus lessening i mpact on critical operations 
32 
 and related services, functions and systems. While it may not be possible to avoid 
certain Operational Risk s, such as a pandemic, it is possible to improve the 
resilience of a n RE’s operations to such event s.  
10.2 Business continuity, dependencies on third parties , and the technology upon 
which REs rely are important factors for REs to consider when strengthening their 
operational resilience.  
10.3 It is essential for REs  to ensure that existing risk management frameworks, 
business continuity plans , and third- party dependency  management are 
implemented consistently within the organisation. As operational resilience draws 
from such element s like business continuity, third- party risk management, ICT & 
cyber ri sk management, incident management, and wider aspects of Operational 
Risk Management , a holistic approach is essential if an  RE is to enhance the 
resilience of its critical operations , regardless of the type of disruption.  Approaching 
operational resilienc e through a critical operations lens encourages an RE to 
prioritise what is critical or important to the RE and the financial system, and 
understand the interconnections and interdependencies involved in delivering those 
operations. REs should therefore verify that  their operational resilience approach is 
appropriately harmonised with the stated actions, organisational mappings, critical operations  and critical shared services  (including the services which are essential for 
the industry)  contained in their recovery and resolution plans , which ultimately are 
important for the financial system stability.  
11. Mapping of I nterconnections and I nterdependencies 
Principle  10: Once an RE has identified its critical operations, it should map 
the internal and external  interconnections and interdependencies that are 
necessary for the delivery of critical operations consistent with its approach to 
operational resilience.  
11.1  The respective functions should map (i .e., identify and document) the people, 
technology, proc esses, information, facilities, and the interconnections and 
interdependencies among them as needed to deliver the RE’s critical operations, including those dependent upon, but not limited to, third parties or intragroup 
arrangements.  
11.2 REs may leverage their recovery and resolution plans, as appropriate, for 
definitions of critical operations  and should consider whether their operational 
33 
 resilience approaches are appropriately harmonised with those of the organisational 
mappings of critical operations and critical third -party service providers as  contained 
in their respective recovery and resolution plans.  
11.3  The approach and level of granularity of mapping should be sufficient for RE s 
to identify vulnerabilities and to support testing of their abilit y to deliver critical 
operations through disruption,  considering the RE’s risk appetite and tolerance for 
disruption.  Such a mapping will enable the RE to pinpoint vulnerabilities in how 
critical operations are being delivered and determine where recovery and resolution 
plans can be leveraged. Examples of such vulnerabilities could include concentration risk, single points of failure, and inadequate substitutability of service providers and 
resources.  
11.4 Where an RE  is a member of a group, it must ensure that any additional risks 
arising elsewhere in the group are accounted for that may affect its ability to tackle 
with a severe but plausible disruption to its operations . 
12. Third- party dependency management  
Principle  11: REs should manage their dependenc ies on relationships, 
including those of, but not limited to, third parties (which include intragroup 
entities), for the delivery of critical operations.  
12.1 REs should perform a risk assessment and due diligence before entering into 
arrangements includi ng those of, but not limited to, third parties (which include 
intragroup entities ), consistent with its  ORMF ,11 third-party risk management policy , 
and operational resilience approach. Prior to entering into such an arrangement, the RE should verify whether  the third party, including, the intragroup entity to these 
arrangements, has at least an equivalent level of operational resilience to safeguard 
the RE’s critical operations in both normal circumstances and the event of  a 
disruption.   
                                                            
11 The management of dependencies articulated in this principle should be consistent with and conducted alongside the  control 
and risk mitigation policies (principle 9) of this Guidance Note.  
34 
 Few examples of what constitute third- party service providers is shown in figure 
below (indicative and not an exhaustive list)  
 
12.2 The Board of D irectors and S enior Management are responsible for 
understanding the Operational Risks associated with third -party  arrangements  and 
ensuring that effective risk management policies and practices are in place to 
manage the risk in such  activities.  A Board approved policy on management of 
service providers is critical for managing risks associated with reliance on third parties whether related or unrelated to RE. Third- party risk policies (as a part of the 
ORMF’s policies) and risk management activities should encompass:   
12.2.1  Procedures for determining whether there is a need for entering into a third-
party arrangement for a serv ice and how  to enter into such an arrangement . 
12.2.2  Processes for conducting due diligence in the selection of potential service 
providers.  
12.2.3  Sound structuring of the third -party  arrangement, including ownership and 
confidentiality of data, as well as termination rights.  
12.2.4   Programmes for managing and monitoring the risks associated with the t hird-
party  arrangement, including the financial condition of the service provider.  
12.2.5  Establishment of an effective control environment at the RE and the service 
provider that should include a register of third-party relationships  (that identifies  the 
criticality of different services ) and metrics and reporting to facilitate oversight of the 
service provider.  
12.2.6  Development of viable contingency plans.  
35 
 12.2.7   Execution of comprehensive contracts and/or service level agreements  
(which are enforceable)  with a clear allocation of responsibilities between the third -
party service  provider and the RE, provided the ultimate responsibility vests with the 
RE. 
12.2.8  REs’ supervisory and resolution authorities’ access to third parties.  
12.3 REs should develop appropriate business continuity including  contingency 
planning procedures and exit strategies to maintain their operational resilience in the 
event of a failure or disruption at a third -party  level impacting the provision of critical 
operations. Scenarios under the RE’s business continuity plans should assess the 
substitutability of third parties that provide services to the RE’s critical operations, 
and other  viable alternatives that may facilitate operational resilience in the event of 
an outage at a third party, such as bringing the service back in- house.   
12.4 Along with an increasing reliance on service providers, complexity in supply 
chains  have also risen. A large  number of service providers  are subcontracting the 
services who are themselves  reliant on another service provider for the provision of a 
service (a fourth party). In certain cases, these fourth party service providers can, in 
turn, be r eliant upon yet another service provider , and further till nth service provider, 
thus elongating the chain. Such an arrangement result s in an RE  relying on 
downstream service providers without a direct agreement in place. Such supply chain vulnerabilities and lack of transparency may increase Operational Risk  for RE . 
This can also impede its ability to manage risks in the supply chain as well have an 
effect on the regulator’s  expectations on the RE. Therefore,  REs are expected to be 
aware of, and manage, the risks associated with any further downstream service providers, to maintain a thorough understanding of the supply chain and potential issues that could affect the entity’s ability to maintain its critical operations . 
Therefore, REs, in their agreement w ith the service providers, should include clauses 
making the service provider contractually liable for the performance and risk management practices of its sub- contractors  (including nth parties in the supply 
chain) . 
    
36 
  
13. Business Continuity Planning and Testing 
Principle  12: REs should have business continuity plans in place to ensure 
their ability to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of a 
severe business disruption. Business continuity plans should be linked to the 
RE’s ORMF. R Es should conduct business continuity exercises under a range 
of severe but plausible scenarios in order to test their ability to deliver critical 
operations through disruption.  
13.1 Sound and effective governance of REs’ business continuity plan requires:  
13.1.1 Regular review and approval by the B oard of D irectors. 
13.1.2  The strong involvement of the S enior Management and business units’ 
leaders in its implementation.  
13.1.3  The commitment of the first and second lines of defence to its design.  
13.1.4  Regula r review by the third line of defence.  
13.2 REs should prepare forward- looking business continuity plan (BCP) with 
scenario analyses associated with relevant impact assessments and recovery 
procedures:  
13.2.1  An RE should ground its business continuity plan on scenario analyses of 
potential disruptions that identify and categorise critical business operations and key internal or external dependencies. In doing so, REs should cover all their business units as well as critical providers and major third parties.  
13.2.2  Each scenario should be subject to a quantitative and qualitative impact 
assessment or business impact analysis (BIA) with regards to its financial, 
operational, legal and reputational consequences.  
13.2.3  Disruption scenarios should be subject t o thresholds or limits (such as 
maximum tolerable outage) for the activation of a business continuity procedure. The business continuity procedure should meet the defined recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO). The procedure should also address recovery strategies and methodologies, resumption aspects, as well as communication guidelines for informing management, employees, regulatory authoriti es, customers, suppliers, and where appropriate other  authorities.  
13.2.4  These plans s hould also incorporate testing programmes, training and 
awareness programmes, and communication and crisis management programmes.  
37 
 13.3 Business continuity plans should develop, implement and maintain a regular 
business continuity exercise encompassing crit ical operations and their 
interconnections and interdependencies, including those through relationships with, 
but not limited to, third parties and intragroup entities. Business continuity exercises should be conducted and validated for a range of severe but plausible scenarios that incorporate disruptive events and incidents.  Among other business continuity goals, 
business continuity exercises should support staff’s operational resilience awareness including training of staff  which should be customised bas ed on specific cases  so 
that they can effectively adapt and respond to incidents.  
13.4 Business continuity plans should provide detailed guidance for implementing 
the RE’s disaster recovery framework. These plans should establish the roles and 
responsibili ties for managing operational disruptions and provide clear guidance 
regarding the succession of authority in the event of a disruption that impacts key 
personnel. Additionally, these plans should clearly set out the internal decision-making process and define the triggers for invoking the RE’s business continuity plan.  
13.5 REs’ business continuity plans for the delivery of critical operations and critical 
third-party services contained in their recovery and resolution plans  should be 
consistent with their  operational resilience approaches.  
13.6 An RE should periodically review its business continuity plans and policies to 
ensure that strategies remain consistent with current operations, risks and threats. Business continuity procedures should be tested per iodically to ensure that recovery 
and resumption objectives and timeframes can be met. Where possible, an RE should participate in business continuity testing with service providers. Results of formal testing and review activities should be reported to S enior Management and 
the Board of D irectors. 
13.7 In view of Covid -19, preparing for future pandemics of varied kind should be 
one of REs’ top priorities. One key challenge REs face in such pandemics is the possibility of low staff availability which could p otentially disrupt business operations 
for prolonged periods. The Business Continuity Planning of an RE should therefore include measures to mitigate the impact of such future pandemics. REs should put in place a comprehensive organisation- wide preparednes s and response plan to deal 
with the different stages of a future outbreak or any such unforeseeable 
38 
 circumstances. The plan should preferably be aligned with the comprehensive 
ORMF  of the RE.  
14. Incident management  
Principle  13: REs should develop and im plement response and recovery plans 
to manage incidents that could disrupt the delivery of critical operations in line 
with the RE’s risk appetite and tolerance for disruption. REs should 
continuously improve their incident response and recovery plans by 
incorporating the lessons learned from previous incidents.  
14.1 REs should maintain an inventory of incident response and recovery, internal 
and third- party resources to support its  response and recovery capabilities.  
14.2 The scope of incident management should capture the life cycle of an 
incident,12 typically including, but not limited to:  
14.2.1  The classification of an incident’s severity based on predefined criteria ( e.g., 
expected time to return to business as usual), enabling proper prioritisation of  and 
assignment of resources to respond to an incident.  
14.2.2  The incident response and recovery procedures, including their connection to 
the RE’s business continuity, disaster recovery , and other associated management 
plans and procedures.  
14.2.3  The im plementation of communication plans to report incidents to both 
internal and external stakeholders ( e.g., regulatory authorities), including 
performance metrics during, and analysis of lessons learned after an incident . The 
internal communication plan should contain escalation routes on how to communicate with key decision makers, operational staff and third parties , if 
necessary. The external communication plan should outline how the entity will communicate with its customers, stakeholders, and regulators during a disruption.  
14.3 Incident response and recovery procedures should be periodically reviewed, 
tested,  and updated by the REs . They should also identify  and address the root 
causes of incidents to prevent or minimise serial recurrence.  
14.4 The l esso ns learned from previous incidents including incidents experienced 
by others  as well as near misses  should be duly reflected when updating the incident 
management programme. A n RE’s incident management programme should 
                                                            
12 Recognising that the life cycle of an i ncident could span multiple measures of time that could range from hours to weeks to 
months.   
39 
 manage all incidents impacting the RE, including those attributable to dependencies 
on, but not limited to, third parties and intragroup entities.  
15. Information and C ommunication Technology  (ICT) including Cyber 
Security  
Principle  14: REs should implement a robust Information and Communicat ion 
Technology (ICT) risk management programme in alignment with their ORMF 
and ensure a resilient ICT including cyber security that is subject to 
protection, detection, response, and recovery programmes that are regularly 
tested, incorporate appropriate s ituational awareness and convey relevant 
timely information for risk management and decision- making processes to 
fully support and facilitate the delivery of the RE’s critical operations.  
15.1 Effective ICT performance and security are paramount for an RE  to conduct 
its business properly. The appropriate use and implementation of sound ICT risk management contributes to the effectiveness of the control environment and is fundamental to the achievement of an RE’s strategic objectives. An RE’s ICT risk asses sment should ensure that its ICT fully supports and facilitates its operations. 
ICT risk management should reduce an RE’s Operational Risk  exposure to direct 
losses, legal claims, reputational damage, ICT disruption and misuse of technology in alignment wi th its risk appetite and tolerance statement.  
15.2 ICT risk management includes:  
15.2.1 ICT risk identification and assessment, including critical information, assets 
and infrastructure.  
15.2.2 ICT risk mitigation measures consistent with the assessed risk  level (e.g. 
cybersecurity, response and recovery programmes, ICT change management processes, ICT incident management processes, including relevant information transmission to users on a timely basis).  
15.2.3  Monitoring of these mitigation measures (including regular tests).  
15.3 REs should have a documented ICT policy, including cyber security, which 
stipulates governance and oversight requirements, risk ownership and accountability, ICT security measures ( e.g., access controls, critical information 
asset  protection, identity management), periodic evaluation and monitoring of cyber 
security controls, and incident response, as well as business continuity and disaster recovery plans.  
40 
 15.4 To ensure data and systems’ confidentiality, integrity and availabilit y, the 
Board of D irectors / its Committee  should regularly oversee the effectiveness of the 
RE’s ICT risk management and S enior Management should routinely evaluate the 
design, implementation and effectiveness of the RE’s ICT risk management. This 
requires regular alignment of the business, risk management and ICT strategies to 
be consistent with the RE’s risk appetite and tolerance statement as well as with privacy and other applicable laws. REs should continuously monitor its ICT and regularly report to S enior Management on ICT risks, controls and events.  
15.5 ICT risk management together with complementing processes set by the REs 
should:  
15.5.1  be reviewed on a regular basis for completeness against relevant industry 
standards and best practices as well as against evolving threats (e.g., cyber) and evolving or new technologies. Threat profile for critical information assets should be reviewed and tested for vulnerabilities on a more frequent basis in order to ensure resilience to the ICT related risks;  
15.5.2 be regularly tested as part of a programme to identify gaps against stated risk 
tolerance objectives and facilitate improvement of the ICT risk identification/  
detection and event management; and 
15.5.3 make use of actionable intelligence to continuous ly enhance their situational 
awareness of vulnerabilities to ICT systems, networks and applications and facilitate effective decision making in risk or change management . 
15.6 REs should develop approaches to ICT readiness for stressed scenarios from 
disru ptive external events, such as the need to facilitate the implementation of wide-
scale remote- access, rapid deployment of physical assets and/or significant 
expansion of bandwidth to support remote user connections and customer data protection. REs should ensure that:  
15.6.1 appropriate risk mitigation strategies are developed for potential risks 
associated with a disruption or compromise of ICT systems, networks and applications. They should evaluate whether the risks, taken together with these 
strategies,  fall within its  risk appetite and risk tolerance;  
15.6.2 well defined processes for the management of privileged users and 
application development are in place; and 
41 
 15.6.3  regular updates are made to ICT including cyber security in order to maintain 
an appropriate security posture.  
15.7 In light of the recent shift in preferences and the dependence on technology 
for functioning of REs, they should prioritise their cyber security efforts based on ICT 
risk assessment and the significance of the critical information assets for its critical 
operations while observing all pertinent legal and regulatory requirements relating to 
data protection and confidentiality. REs should develop plans and implement controls to maintain the integrity of critical information in the event of a cyber -event, 
such as secure storage and offline backup on immutable media of data supporting critical operations.  
Pillar 3: Learn and Adapt  
16. D isclosure  and Reporting  
Principle 15 : An RE’s public disclosures should allow stakeholders to assess 
its approach to Operational Risk management and its Operational Risk 
exposure.  
16.1 An RE’s public disclosure of relevant Operational Risk Management  
information can lead to transparency and the development of better industry practices through market discipline.  The disclosures also allow REs to undertake a 
peer-to-peer comparative analysis for improving their own processes and controls. 
The extent  and type of disclosure should be commensurate with the size, risk profile 
and complexity of an RE’s op erations, and evolving industry practice.  
16.2 REs should disclose relevant Operational Risk  exposure information to their 
stakeholders (including significant operational loss events), while not creating Operational Risk  through this disclosure ( e.g., description of unaddressed control 
vulnerabilities). A n RE should disclose its ORMF in a manner that allows 
stakeholders to determine whether the RE identifies, assesses, monitors and 
controls/mitigates Operational Risk  effectively.  
16.3 REs should have a formal disclosure policy that is subject to regular and 
independent review and approval by the S enior Management and the B oard of 
Directors , respectively. The policy should address the RE’s approach for determining 
what Operational Risk  disclosures it will m ake and the internal controls over the 
42 
 disclosure process. In addition, REs should implement a process for assessing the 
appropriateness of their disclosures and disclosure policy.  
16.4  Where possible, direct reporting mechanisms with supervisors and audi tors 
may be established for ensuring an ongoing review of the ORMF also enabling supervisors to encourage REs’ ongoing internal development efforts by monitoring, 
comparing and evaluating RE s’ recent improvements and plans for prospective 
developments . 
17. Lessons Learned Exercise and Adapting 
Principle 16: A lessons learned exercise should be conducted after a 
disruption to a critical or important business service to enhance an RE’s 
capabilities to adapt and respond to future operational events.  
 
17.1 An RE should conduct a ‘ lessons learned exercise ’,
 including Root Cause 
Analysis, after any disruption to a business service with emphasis on critical service. 
This includes any potential material disruption to a third- party provider  (including but 
not limite d to a group entity)  that feeds into the delivery of a critical business service.   
17.2 The lessons learned exercise should utilise the information gathered as part 
of the incident management and disaster recovery process. The decisions and 
recovery proces ses determined to be appropriate throughout the incident 
management process should form the basis of the lessons learned exercise.  
17.3 An RE should have predetermined criteria or questions basis the lessons 
learned exercise from the incidents. These quest ions should identify deficiencies, 
which caused induced failure in the continuity of service and these deficiencies 
should be addressed as a matter of priority. Specifically, at a minimum, the following 
should be considered:  
 
43 
 17.4 The lessons learned exer cises should define effective remediation measures 
to redress deficiencies and failure in the continuity of service. The more efficient use 
of resources for critical operations and adjustments to any impact tolerances determine whether a failure could have a wider impact on financial stability. A report/ 
self-assessment analysis document post the incident containing the above should be 
presented to the Board.  
17.5 The lessons learned exercise allows an  RE to reflect on the three- pillar 
approach to operational resilience and allows for a feedback loop into the first two pillars that encourages improvement in how an  RE prepares for and recovers from 
disruptions.  Doing so will also allow an  RE to agree remedial actions and adjust any 
impact tolerances if determ ined.   
18. Continuous improvement through Feedback Systems 
Principle 17 : An RE should promote an effective culture of learning and 
continuous improvement as operational resilience evolves through effective 
feedback systems.  
 
18.1 Continuous improvements t o operational resilience requires an RE to learn 
from its experiences as changes to its operati onal approaches or  technology 
infrastructure mature over time. This should not only occur after a disruption or 
incident has occurred but should form part of ongoing operational resilience 
discussions.  
18.2 An RE should promote an effective cultur e of learning and continuous 
improvement as operational resilience evolves. Operational resilience needs to be a 
fundamental element of any strategic decision taken by an  RE.  
18.3 REs should develop robust feedback systems to ensure a continuous positive 
feedback loop fostering an effective learning environment, which in turn helps them frame better ORMF s and build adequate Operational Resilience.  
18.4 In the above contex t, an effective feedback system properly identifies and 
assesses the type, nature and severity of potential Operational Risk s that could be 
faced by an RE as  well as where the vulnerabilities lie and need to be addressed.  
Based on the same, a required set of control and mitigation measures can be  
developed to tackle these risks. Further, based on real time operational incidents or disruptions that have occurred despite the mitigation measures, the feedback system 
44 
 updates the type, nature and severity of pot ential Operational Risk s and hence 
updates the required set of control and mitigation measures to tackle these risks. 
Errors/mistakes in the existing controls and processes should also be incorporated in the feedback for ensuring rectification and necessar y updation. In this way, through 
feedback, an RE maintains optimal operational resilience as shown in figure  below.
