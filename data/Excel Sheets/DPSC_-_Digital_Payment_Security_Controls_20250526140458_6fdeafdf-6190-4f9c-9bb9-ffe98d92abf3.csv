DPSC_-_Digital_Payment_Security_Controls_20250526140458_6fdeafdf-6190-4f9c-9bb9-ffe98d92abf3,Main Document,1,Introduction,,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,No,Not Started,,"The document outlines the ""Master Direction on Digital Payment Security Controls"" issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to strengthen security frameworks around digital payment systems. It emphasizes the critical importance of secure governance structures and the implementation of uniform security controls for various digital payment channels including internet banking, mobile payments, and card transactions. The document is applicable to all regulated entities including scheduled commercial banks, small finance banks, payments banks, and credit card issuing NBFCs. 

The directive begins with an introduction that establishes the regulatory framework and the necessity of these guidelines in light of the growing reliance on digital payment methods in India. It lays out detailed provisions that require institutions to formulate security policies approved by their boards, identifying specifying security risks and compliance requirements. Key elements highlighted include the necessity for organizations to conduct periodic risk assessments, establish robust internal controls, and ensure adequate training for their personnel in managing the digital payment infrastructure. 

Specific controls are prescribed across various categories, including governance, general security protocols, internet banking, mobile application security, and card payment security. Requirements for data protection, encryption standards, multi-factor authentication methods, fraud risk management, and customer protection mechanisms are delineated throughout the document. In particular, there are clear mandates on the secure handling of customer data and procedures for reporting and addressing grievances.

To reinforce security, the guidelines encourage regulated entities to adopt a ""secure by design"" approach, integrate regular testing of their security measures, and keep abreast of their payment systems' resilience against cyber threats and incidents. Further recommendations cover the incorporation of advanced technologies for monitoring suspicious activities and alerting customers promptly about potential security breaches.

The document clearly delineates the responsibilities of senior management in executing these requirements, emphasizing a culture of compliance that is responsive to emerging risks in digital payment security.","- Establish a robust digital payment security policy approved by the Board, addressing specific security controls and risk management measures.
- Conduct comprehensive risk assessments on digital payment products, incorporating fraud risk management and compliance mechanisms.
- Implement multi-factor authentication for all digital payment transactions without exception, ensuring secure authentication methods.
- Develop a grievance redressal mechanism to address customer complaints on digital payment services efficiently.
- Ensure all personnel handling digital payment infrastructure are adequately trained on security controls and risk management practices.
- Periodically review and test the effectiveness of security controls, including data encryption, and safeguard customer information during transactions.
- Monitor and address suspicious transaction behavior through defined parameters and alert systems as per the outlined security controls."

The contours of the policy, while discussing the parameters of any “new product” including its alignment with the overall business strategy and inherent risk of the product, risk management/ mitigation measures, compliance with regulatory instructions, customer experience, etc., should explicitly discuss about payment security requirements from Functionality, Security and Performance (FSP) angles such as: - a) Necessary controls to protect the confidentiality of customer data and integrity of data and processes associated with the digital product/ services offered; - b) Availability of requisite infrastructure e.g. human resources, technology, etc. with necessary back up; - c) Assurance that the payment product is built in a secure manner offering robust performance ensuring safety, consistency and rolled out after necessary testing for achieving desired FSP; - d) Capacity building and expansion with scalability (to meet the growth for efficient transaction processing); - e) Minimal customer service disruption with high availability of systems/ channels (to have minimal technical declines); - f) Efficient and effective dispute resolution mechanism and handling of customer grievance; and - g) Adequate and appropriate review mechanism followed by swift corrective action, in case any one of the above requirements is hampered or having high potential to get hampered. The Board and Senior Management shall be responsible for implementation of this policy. The policy shall be reviewed periodically, at least on a yearly basis. REs may formulate this policy separately for its different digital products or include the same as part of their overall product policy. Further, the policy document should require that every digital payment product/ services offered addresses the mechanics, clear definition of starting point, critical intermittent stages/ points and end point in the digital payment cycle, security aspects, validations till the digital payment is settled, clear pictorial representation of digital path and exception handling. In addition, signing off of the above requirements, mechanism for carrying out User Acceptance Tests (UAT) in multiple stages before roll out, sign off from multiple stakeholders (post UAT) and data archival requirements shall also be taken into account. The need for an external assessment of the entire process including the logic, build and security aspects of the application(s) supporting the digital product should be clearly articulated.","Regulated Entities (REs) must develop and periodically review a comprehensive policy for digital payment products that addresses security, infrastructure, customer service, testing, and dispute resolution with Board approval.",Formulate and get Board approval for a digital payment policy that covers all specified security and operational requirements.,2026-05-26,annual,No,Not Started,,,

At least one of the authentication methodologies should be generally dynamic or non-replicable. [e.g., Use of One Time Password, mobile devices (device binding and SIM), biometric/ PKI/ hardware tokens, EMV chip card (for Card Present Transactions) with server-side verification could be termed either in dynamic or non-replicable methodologies.] - REs may also adopt adaptive authentication to select the right authentication factors depending on risk assessment, user risk profile and behaviour. Properly designed and implemented multi-factor authentication methods are more reliable and stronger fraud deterrents and are more difficult to compromise. The key objectives of multi-factor authentication are to protect the confidentiality of payment data as well as enhance confidence in digital payment by combating various cyber-attack mechanisms like phishing, keylogging, spyware/ malware and other internet-based frauds targeted at REs and their customers.",Regulated Entities (REs) must implement multi-factor authentication for electronic payments and fund transfers to enhance security against cyber-attacks.,Deploy multi-factor authentication for all electronic payments and fund transfers by incorporating at least one dynamic or non-replicable method.,2025-11-26,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,
