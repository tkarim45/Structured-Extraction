Operational_Resilience_20250525194036_5ed433d2-869e-4e93-8db5-277be389464d,Main Document,1,Purpose,"- 1.1 Operational Risk is inherent in all banking/ financial products, services, activities, processes, and systems. Effective management of Operational Risk is an integral part of the Regulated Entities’ (REs) risk management framework. Sound Management of Operational Risk shows the overall effectiveness of the Board of Directors and Senior Management in administering the RE’s portfolio of products, services, activities, processes, and systems. - 1.2 An operational disruption can threaten the viability of an RE, impact its customers and other market participants, and ultimately have an impact on financial stability. It can result from man-made causes, Information Technology (IT) threats (e.g., cyber-attacks, changes in technology, technology failures, etc.), geopolitical conflicts, business disruptions, internal/external frauds, execution/delivery errors, third-party dependencies, or natural causes (e.g., climate change, pandemic, etc.). - 1.3 An RE needs to factor in the entire gamut of risks (including the aforesaid risks in its risk assessment policies/processes), identify and assess them using appropriate tools, monitor its material operational exposures, and devise appropriate risk mitigation/management strategies using strong internal controls to minimize operational disruptions and continue to deliver critical operations, thus ensuring operational resilience. - 1.4 Until recently, the predominant Operational Risks that REs faced emanated from vulnerabilities related to increasing dependence and rapid adoption of technology for provision of financial services and intermediation. However, the financial sector’s growing reliance on third-party providers (including technology service providers) exacerbated by Covid-19 pandemic with greater reliance on virtual working arrangements has highlighted the increasing importance of Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience; which not only benefits the RE by strengthening its ability to remain a viable going concern but also supports the financial system by ensuring continuous delivery of critical operations during any disruption. - 1.5 In view of the foregoing, the Reserve Bank, through this Guidance Note on Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience (hereafter ‘Guidance Note’) intends to: - 1.5.1 promote and further improve the effectiveness of Operational Risk Management of the REs, and - 1.5.2 enhance their Operational Resilience given the interconnections and interdependencies, within the financial system, that result from the complex and dynamic environment in which the REs operate. - 1.6 This Guidance Note updates the “Guidance Note on Management of Operational Risk” dated October 14, 2005. It has been prepared based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) principles documents issued in March 2021, viz., (a) ‘Revisions to the Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk’ and (b) ‘Principles for Operational Resilience’ as well as some of the international best practices. - 1.7 The Guidance Note has adopted a principle-based and proportionate approach to ensure smooth implementation across REs of various sizes, nature, complexity, geographic location, and risk profile of their businesses. Although the exact approach may vary from RE to RE, the Guidance Note provides an overarching guidance to REs for improving and further strengthening their Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF). It gives adequate flexibility to REs for Operational Risk Management to enhance their ability to withstand, adapt and recover from potential operational disruptions and ensure their Operational Resilience. The systems, procedures, and tools prescribed in this Guidance Note are indicative in nature and should be read in conjunction with the relevant instructions issued by Reserve Bank from time to time. In case of inconsistency, if any, the relevant instructions issued by the Reserve Bank would prevail. - 1.8 The operational risk regulatory capital requirements shall continue to be guided by the applicable guidelines.","Regulated Entities must enhance their Operational Risk Management and Resilience to mitigate disruptions from various risks, aligning with Basel Committee principles.",Review and adapt the Operational Risk Management Framework as per the Guidance Note and applicable instructions from the Reserve Bank.,N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,,"The Guidance Note on Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience issued by the Reserve Bank of India aims to enhance the operational risk management frameworks (ORMF) and operational resilience of regulated entities (REs) in the financial sector. It acknowledges the increasing significance of operational risk due to technological dependencies and external disruptions such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. This comprehensive document outlines a principle-based framework emphasizing the three lines of defense model, which includes responsibilities for business units, an organizational operational risk management function, and audit functions. It stresses that effective governance, risk culture, identification, assessment, monitoring, control, response to incidents, and recovery strategies are essential components of a robust ORMF. The document highlights the importance of business continuity planning, management of third-party dependencies, and ongoing learning through lessons learned exercises and feedback mechanisms to ensure resilience during operational disruptions. Compliance with the updated requirements is crucial for maintaining financial stability and safeguarding organizational operations.","Regulated Entities must establish and implement a comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF) that integrates with their overall risk management processes. This framework should involve the three lines of defense model, ensuring clear responsibilities for business units, independent risk management, and internal auditing. Additionally, REs should regularly assess and test their business continuity plans and operational resilience strategies against severe but plausible disruption scenarios, creating robust incident management processes that include recovery plans and lessons learned exercises. This action will help mitigate operational risks and enhance the entity's ability to respond to disruptions effectively, thereby ensuring compliance with the new Guidance Note."

Operational_Resilience_20250525194036_5ed433d2-869e-4e93-8db5-277be389464d,Main Document,1,Preliminary - Introduction and Background,"- 1.1 Introduction - 1.1.1 The global financial crisis greatly impacted financial stability around the world. Given the fact that the effects of crisis were much more severe than all the scenarios envisaged by banks as part of their stress tests, several structural changes were undertaken to strengthen banks’/financial institutions’ financial resilience. Though capital and liquidity requirements have improved the ability of banks to absorb shocks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) was of the view that more work needs to be done in the area of Operational Risk Management to provide additional safeguards to the financial system. - 1.1.2 The BCBS recognized Operational Risk as a distinct class of risk in 2001, outside of credit and market risks and came out with Sound Practices for Management and Supervision of Operational Risk in 2003. Subsequently, these principles were revised in 2011, to incorporate the lessons learnt from the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09. In 2014, a review of the implementation of these Principles was carried out to assess the extent to which banks had implemented these Principles, identify significant gaps, if any, in their implementation and highlight emerging and noteworthy Operational Risk Management practices at banks which may be included in the Principles. It was also observed that several Principles have not yet been adequately implemented, and there was a need for further guidance to facilitate their implementation in areas such as risk identification and assessment tools, key risk indicators, business process mapping, monitoring of action plans, change management programmes and processes, implementation of the three lines of defence, oversight by Board of Directors and Senior Management, articulation of Operational Risk appetite and tolerance statements, risk disclosures, etc. BCBS also recognised that the 2011 Principles did not adequately capture certain important sources of Operational Risk, such as those arising from Information and Communication Technology (ICT) risk. - 1.1.3 Subsequently, the onset of Covid-19 pandemic created disruptions affecting information systems, personnel, facilities, relationships with third-party service providers and customers. It altered the way banks operated in view of their increased demands on technology given the greater reliance on virtual working arrangements. In addition, incidents of cyber threats (ransomware attacks, phishing, etc.) spiked, and the likelihood for materialising of the Operational Risk events caused by people, failed processes, and systems increased, which tested the operational resilience of banks. - 1.1.4 In light of the same, BCBS felt that further work was necessary to strengthen banks’ ability to withstand Operational Risk related events such as pandemics, cyber incidents, technology failures, and natural disasters which could cause significant operational failures or widespread disruptions in financial markets. It is in this backdrop, that BCBS came out with updated ‘Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk’ in 2021. Additionally, it also came out with ‘Principles on Operational Resilience’ to enhance the ability of banks to withstand, adapt to and recover from potential hazards. - 1.2 Background - 1.2.1 Operational Risk is a complex risk category, when it comes to identification, quantification and mitigation of risk. It is impacted by numerous factors such as internal business processes, regulatory landscape, business growth, customer preferences, and even factors external to the organization. It is highly dynamic in nature where new and emerging forces such as breakthrough technologies, data availability, new business models, interaction with third parties, etc., continuously create new demands on Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF). - 1.2.2 While Operational Risk Management allows an RE to better identify, assess, and mitigate the Operational Risks, Operational Resilience provides it the ability to deliver critical functions in the event of any disruption. Although Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience address different goals, they are closely interconnected. An effective Operational Risk Management system and a robust level of Operational Resilience work together to reduce the frequency and the impact of Operational Risk events. In view of the above, Reserve Bank, through this Guidance Note intends to promote Operational Risk Management and enhance the Operational Resilience of REs. - 1.2.3 This Guidance Note on Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience has been built on three pillars. The three pillars are: - (i) Prepare and Protect - (ii) Build Resilience - (iii) Learn and Adapt - 1.2.4 These three pillars support a holistic approach to the management of Operational Risk and Operational Resilience and create a feedback loop that fosters perpetual embedding of lessons learned into an RE’s preparation for operational disruptions and its performance during actual occurrence of disruptions. Across these three pillars, the Guidance Note contains 17 principles detailed hereafter in paragraphs 4-18.",The BCBS has released updated principles for the sound management of Operational Risk and Operational Resilience to help banks better withstand disruptions and enhance their operational frameworks.,Review and implement the updated principles for Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience as outlined in the Guidance Note.,N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,
Operational_Resilience_20250525194036_5ed433d2-869e-4e93-8db5-277be389464d,Main Document,2,Definitions,"- 2.1 “Business unit” is responsible for identifying and managing the risks inherent in the products, services, activities, processes and systems for which it is accountable and includes all associated support, corporate and/or shared service functions, e.g., Finance, Human Resources, and Operations and Technology. It does not include Risk Management and Internal Audit functions unless otherwise specifically indicated. - 2.2 “Critical operations” refers to critical functions, activities, processes, services and their relevant supporting assets the disruption of which would be material to the continued operation of the RE or its role in the financial system. Whether a particular operation is “critical” depends on the nature of the RE and its role in the financial system. REs’ tolerance for disruption should be applied at the critical operations level. - 2.3 “Event management” is the process of identification, analysis, end-to-end management and reporting of an operational risk event that follows a pre-determined set of protocols. - 2.4 “Incidents” are current or past disruptive events the occurrence of which would have an adverse effect on critical operations of the RE. Incident management is the process of identifying, analysing, rectifying and learning from an incident (including a cyber incident) and preventing recurrences or mitigating the severity thereof. The goal of incident management is to limit the disruption and restore critical operations in line with the RE’s risk tolerance for disruption. - 2.5 “Information and Communication Technology” refers to the underlying physical and logical design of information technology and communication systems, the individual hardware and software components, data, and the operating environment. - 2.6 “Mapping” is the process of identifying, documenting, and understanding the chain of activities involved in delivering critical operations. It incorporates the identification of all interdependencies and interconnections including people, processes, technology and third parties. - 2.7 “Operational resilience” means the ability of an RE to deliver critical operations through disruption. This ability enables an RE to identify and protect itself from threats and potential failures, respond and adapt to, as well as recover and learn from disruptive events to minimise their impact on the delivery of critical operations through disruption. In considering its operational resilience, an RE should assume that disruptions will occur, and take into account its overall risk appetite and tolerance for disruption or impact tolerance. - 2.8 “Operational Risk” means the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. It includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk and it is inherent in all banking/financial products, activities, processes and systems. - 2.9 “Operational Risk Management” refers to entire gamut of activities right from risk identification, measurement and assessment, monitoring and control, mitigation, reporting to senior management and the Board of Directors on the RE’s risk exposures, Business Continuity Management, and learning through feedback for improvement. - 2.10 “Operational Risk profiles” describe the Operational Risk exposures and control environment assessments of business units of REs and it considers the range of potential impacts that could arise from estimates of expected to plausible severe losses. - 2.11 “Regulated Entities” (REs) refers to the entities mentioned below: - 2.11.1 All Commercial Banks; - 2.11.2 All Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks/State Co-operative Banks/ Central Co-operative Banks; - 2.11.3 All All-India Financial Institutions (AIFIs); - 2.11.4 All Non-Banking Financial Companies including Housing Finance Companies. - 2.12 “Respective functions” refers to the appropriate function(s) within the RE’s three lines of defence, which are (i) business unit management; (ii) an independent Operational Risk Management including Compliance function; and (iii) audit function. - 2.13 “Risk appetite” is the aggregate level and types of risk an RE is willing to assume, decided in advance and within its risk capacity, to achieve its strategic objectives and business plan. - 2.14 “Risk tolerance” is the variation around the prescribed risk appetite that the RE is willing to tolerate. - 2.15 “Supervisory Authority” means, - 2.15.1 Reserve Bank of India in case of Commercial Banks (including Local Area Banks, Payments Banks, Small Finance Banks, and Primary Urban Co-operative Banks), Non-Banking Financial Companies, and All India Financial Institutions. - 2.15.2 National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development (NABARD) in case of State Co-operative Banks, Central Co-operative Banks, and Regional Rural Banks. - 2.15.3 National Housing Bank (NHB) in case of Housing Finance Companies. - 2.16 “Tolerance for disruption or Impact Tolerance” is the level of disruption from any type of Operational Risk an RE is willing to accept given a range of severe but plausible scenarios.","This section defines key terms relevant to operational resilience and risk management for regulated entities (REs), including concepts such as critical operations, operational risk, and risk tolerance.",Incorporate definitions of operational resilience and related terms into the RE’s risk management framework documentation.,N/A,N/A,No,Not Started,,,
Operational_Resilience_20250525194036_5ed433d2-869e-4e93-8db5-277be389464d,Main Document,3,Three lines of defence for management of Operational Risk,"- 3.1 Sound internal governance forms the foundation of an effective ORMF. The Operational Risk governance function of REs should be fully integrated into their overall risk management governance structure. REs may leverage their existing risk management functions for this purpose. - 3.2 As a part of their ORMF, REs shall rely on three lines of defence: - 3.2.1 First line of Defence - 3.2.1.1 Business Unit Management typically forms the first line of defence. Sound Operational Risk governance recognises that business unit management is responsible for identifying and managing the risks inherent in the products, services, activities, processes and systems for which it is accountable. REs should have a policy that defines clear roles and responsibilities of relevant business units. The responsibilities of an effective first line of defence in promoting a sound Operational Risk Management culture should include: - (i) Identifying and assessing the materiality of Operational Risks inherent in their respective business units through the use of Operational Risk Management tools; - (ii) Establishing appropriate controls to mitigate inherent Operational Risks, and assessing the design and effectiveness of these controls through the use of the Operational Risk Management tools; - (iii) Reporting whether the business units lack adequate resources, tools and training to ensure identification and assessment of Operational Risks; - (iv) Monitoring and reporting the business units’ Operational Risk profiles, and ensuring their adherence to the established Operational Risk appetite and tolerance statement; and Audit Function (Third Line of Defence) Organisational Operational Risk Management Function including Compliance Function (Second Line of Defence) Business Unit Management (First Line of Defence) - (v) Reporting residual Operational Risks not mitigated by controls, including operational loss events, control deficiencies, process inadequacies, and non-compliance with Operational Risk tolerances. - 3.2.2 Second line of defence - 3.2.2.1 A functionally independent Organisational Operational Risk Management Function (OORF) forms the second line of defence. The responsibilities of an effective second line of defence in promoting a sound Operational Risk Management culture should include: - (i) Developing an independent view regarding business units’ (a) identified material Operational Risks, (b) design and effectiveness of key controls, and (c) risk tolerance; - (ii) Challenging the relevance and consistency of the business unit’s implementation of the Operational Risk Management tools, measurement activities and reporting systems, and providing evidence of this effective challenge; - (iii) Developing and maintaining Operational Risk Management and measurement policies, standards and guidelines; - (iv) Reviewing and contributing to the monitoring and reporting of the Operational Risk profile; and - (v) Designing and providing Operational Risk training and instilling risk awareness. - 3.2.2.2 At smaller REs (i.e., NBFC- Base Layer and Tier 1 & 2 Co-operative Banks for the purpose of this Guidance Note), if functions of both first and second line of defence are carried out by the same unit, independence may be achieved through separation of duties (with documented policies and processes emphasizing the same) and an independent review of processes and functions. In larger REs (i.e., REs other than the smaller REs), the OORF should have a reporting structure independent of the risk-generating business units and be responsible for the design, maintenance and ongoing development of the ORMF within the RE. The OORF typically engages relevant corporate control groups (e.g., Legal, Finance and IT) as well as the overall Risk Management Function of the RE, to support its assessment of the Operational Risks and controls. REs should have a policy which clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of the OORF, reflective of the size and complexity of the organisation. - 3.2.2.3 In addition to the independent ORMF, the second line of defence also typically includes the compliance function. - 3.2.3 Third line of defence - The third line of defence, i.e the audit function provides an independent assurance to the Board regarding the appropriateness of RE’s ORMF. This function’s staff should not be involved in the development, implementation and operation of Operational Risk Management processes which has been carried out by the other two lines of defence. The third line of defence reviews are generally carried out by RE’s internal and/or external audit but may also involve suitably qualified independent third parties. The scope and frequency of reviews should not only be sufficient to cover all activities and legal entities of an RE, aligned with the RE's Operational Risk profile, and identify and prioritize key risk areas that warrant thorough examination but also be responsive to the dynamic nature of the Operational Risk environment. An effective independent review includes two processes: - 3.2.3.1 Validation - Ensuring that the quantification systems used by the RE are sufficiently robust as (i) they provide assurance about the integrity of inputs, assumptions, processes and methodologies and (ii) result in assessment of Operational Risk that credibly reflects the Operational Risk profile of the RE; - 3.2.3.2 Verification - (i) Review of the design and implementation of the Operational Risk Management systems (including compliance and consistency with Board policies) and associated governance processes through the first and second lines of defence (including the independence of the second line of defence); (ii) Review of validation processes to ensure they are independent and implemented in a manner consistent with established RE policies; (iii) Ensuring that business units’ management promptly, accurately and adequately responds to the issues raised, and regularly reports to the Board of Directors or its relevant Committees on pending and closed issues; (iv) Identifying gaps, if any, in the ORMF and reporting to the Board or its relevant Committee; and (v) Providing opinion on the overall adequacy and appropriateness of the ORMF and the associated governance processes across the RE by assessing whether the ORMF meets organisational needs and expectations (such as in respect of the risk appetite and tolerance, and adjustment of the framework to changing circumstances) and complies with statutory and legislative provisions, contractual arrangements, internal rules and ethical conduct. - 3.3 REs should ensure that each line of defence: - 3.3.1 has clearly defined roles and responsibilities; - 3.3.2 is adequately resourced in terms of budget, tools and staff; - 3.3.3 is continuously and adequately trained; - 3.3.4 promotes a sound operational risk management culture across the organisation; and - 3.3.5 communicates with the other lines of defence to reinforce the ORMF. - 3.4 The seamless collaboration between these lines of defence can form a formidable shield, safeguarding not only individual REs but the entire financial system against potential threats and vulnerabilities.","Organizations must establish a three lines of defence framework for effective Operational Risk Management, ensuring defined roles and responsibilities across business units, compliance, and audit functions.",Develop and implement a policy that clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of each line of defence within the organization's Operational Risk Management Framework.,N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,

The Board of Directors and Senior Management should establish a corporate culture guided by strong risk management, set standards and incentives for professional and responsible behaviour, and ensure that staff receives appropriate risk management and ethics training. - 4.1 REs with a strong culture of risk management and ethical business practices are less likely to experience damaging Operational Risk events and are better placed to effectively deal with those events that occur. The actions of the Board of Directors and Senior Management as well as the RE’s risk management policies, processes and systems provide the foundation for a sound risk management culture.",The Board of Directors and Senior Management must foster a strong risk management culture through ethical training and defined standards.,Develop and implement risk management and ethics training for all staff by engaging with Senior Management and the Board of Directors.,N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,

Operational_Resilience_20250525194036_5ed433d2-869e-4e93-8db5-277be389464d,Main Document,Annex,Key changes carried out in the Guidance Note vis- à-vis repealed Guidance Note,"- Particulars Repealed Guidance Note dated October 14, 2005 Guidance Note - Focus Operational risk management. Operational resilience as an outcome of operational risk management. - Applicability It is applicable to Scheduled Commercial Banks. It is applicable to all Commercial Banks, all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), all Co-operative Banks, and all All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs). - Three lines of defence model It does not contain guidance on ‘Three lines of defence’ model. It explicates the ‘Three lines of defence model’ wherein - Business unit forms the first line of defence, - Organizational operational risk management function (including compliance function) forms the second line of defence, and - Audit function forms the third line of defence. - Typical organisational setup It provides a typical organisational setup for operational risk management. As now a variety of regulated entities (REs) are covered, for whom the organisational setup would vary based on the size and nature of activities, the typical organisational setup has not been specified. - Change It has not explicitly specified change management. It has an updated guidance on change management with a specifically detailed Principle on it. - Mapping of internal and external interconnections and interdependencies, Incident management, Information and communication technology (ICT), and Disclosures It is silent on the mapping of internal and external interconnections and interdependencies, incident management, ICT, and disclosures. It has separate Principles for mapping of internal and external interconnections and interdependencies, incident management, ICT, and disclosures. - Third-party relationships It has scattered guidance on outsourcing. It has a focused Principle on Third-party relationship, which is a broader concept than outsourcing. - Lessons learned and feedback It has very limited/no guidance on lessons learnt exercise and continuous feedback mechanism. It has introduced separate Principles on lessons learned exercise and continuous feedback mechanism. - Approaches for operational risk capital calculation It has detailed approaches for operational risk capital calculation. It has dropped the approaches for operational risk capital calculation as REs such as Local Area Banks, Small Finance Banks, Payments Banks, Regional Rural Banks, NBFCs, and Co-operative Banks (covered under the Guidance Note) are presently not required to maintain a separate regulatory capital for operational risk.","The updated Guidance Note replaces the repealed version, detailing enhanced operational risk management principles while expanding applicability to various regulated entities and introducing new frameworks on third-party relationships, lessons learned, and continuous feedback mechanisms.",Review and implement the updated operational risk management principles as per the new Guidance Note for all applicable entities by establishing frameworks for third-party relationships and feedback mechanisms.,N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,
