It establishes guidelines for identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring operational risks, emphasizing a three-lines-of-defense model involving business units, an independent operational risk management function, and an audit function. The guidance outlines responsibilities for the Board of Directors and senior management in fostering a robust risk culture, including regular risk assessments, change management, business continuity planning, incident management, and third-party risk management. It promotes operational resilience by encouraging entities to prepare, protect, and learn from operational disruptions, ensuring they can maintain critical operations. The document further specifies that compliance and governance structures must adapt to an RE's size, complexity, and risk profile, while emphasizing the significance of effective communication and reporting mechanisms. Overall, this updated guidance integrates principles of operational resilience within a comprehensive risk management framework to sustain financial stability and minimize operational disruptions.","Regulated entities must establish a comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF) that includes clear definitions of roles across all three lines of defense, governing procedures for regular risk assessments, incident management protocols, and detailed continuity plans. This framework should be integrated into the organization's overall risk management processes, ensuring that each component aligns with the organization's risk appetite and tolerance for disruption, while incorporating lessons learned from past disruptions to refine future resilience strategies."
