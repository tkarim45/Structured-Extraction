IT_Outsourcing_20250525162853_e8aeef89-8e3b-4d3d-bc40-af7082c0eb6b,Appendix I - Usage of Cloud Computing Services,1,Cloud Service Models,"- There are several cloud deployment and service models that have emerged over time. These are generally based on the extent of technology stack that is proposed to be adopted by the consuming entity. Each of these models come with corresponding service, business benefit and risk profiles. - 1. While considering adoption of cloud solution, it is imperative to analyse the business strategy and goals adopted to the current IT applications footprint and associated costs. Cloud adoption ranges from moving only non-business critical workloads to the cloud to moving critical business applications such as SaaS adoption and the several combinations in-between, which should be based on a business technology risk assessment. - 2. In engaging cloud services, REs shall ensure, inter alia, that the Outsourcing of IT Services policy addresses the entire lifecycle of data, i.e., covering the entire span of time from generation of the data, its entry into the cloud, till the data is permanently erased/deleted. The REs shall ensure that the procedures specified are consistent with business needs and legal and regulatory requirements. - 3. In adoption of cloud services, REs shall take into account the cloud service specific factors, viz., multi-tenancy, multi-location storing/processing of data, etc., and attendant risks, while establishing appropriate risk management framework. Cloud security is a shared responsibility between the RE and the Cloud Service Provider. - 4. Cloud Governance: REs shall adopt and demonstrate a well-established and documented cloud adoption policy. Such a policy should, inter alia, identify the activities that can be moved to the cloud, enable and support protection of various stakeholder interests, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including those on privacy, security, data sovereignty, recoverability and data storage requirements, aligned with data classification. The policy should provide for appropriate due diligence to manage and continually monitor the risks associated with CSPs.",Organizations must analyze their business strategy and ensure cloud service adoption aligns with risk assessments and regulatory requirements.,Develop and document a comprehensive cloud adoption policy addressing data lifecycle and risk management.,N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,

Considerations for selection of CSP: REs shall ensure that the selection of the CSP is based on a comprehensive risk assessment of the CSP. REs shall enter into a contract only with CSPs subject to jurisdictions that uphold enforceability of agreements and the rights available thereunder to REs, including those relating to aspects such as data storage, data protection and confidentiality. - 6. Cloud Services Management and Security Considerations - a) Service and Technology Architecture: REs shall ensure that the service and technology architecture supporting cloud-based applications is built in adherence to globally recognised architecture principles and standards. REs shall prefer a technology architecture that provides for secure container-based data management, where encryption keys and Hardware Security Modules are under the control of the RE. The architecture should provide for a standard set of tools and processes to manage containers, images and releases. Multi-tenancy environments should be protected against data integrity and confidentiality risks, and against co-mingling of data. The architecture should be resilient and enable smooth recovery in case of failure of any one or combination of components across the cloud architecture with minimal impact on data/information security. - b) Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM shall be agreed upon with the CSP and ensured for providing role-based access to the cloud-hosted applications, in respect of user-access and privileged-access. Stringent access controls, as applicable for an on-premise application, may be established for identity and access management to cloud-based applications. Segregation of duties and role conflict matrix should be implemented for all kinds of user-access and privileged-access roles in the cloud-hosted application irrespective of the cloud service model. Access provisioning should be governed by principles of ‘need to know’ and ‘least privileges’. In addition, multi-factor authentication should be implemented for access to cloud applications.","REs must conduct a comprehensive risk assessment when selecting CSPs, ensuring secure architecture and IAM practices including role-based access and multi-factor authentication.",Perform a risk assessment and ensure all IAM protocols are implemented in cloud applications by engaging with chosen CSPs.,N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,
