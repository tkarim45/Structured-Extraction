At least one of the authentication methodologies should be generally dynamic or non-replicable. [e.g., Use of One Time Password, mobile devices (device binding and SIM), biometric/PKI/hardware tokens, EMV chip card (for Card Present Transactions) with server-side verification could be termed either in dynamic or non-replicable methodologies.]","Regulatory entities must implement multi-factor authentication for electronic payments and fund transfers, requiring at least one dynamic or non-replicable authentication method.",Ensure deployment of multi-factor authentication methods for all electronic payment systems by utilizing dynamic or non-replicable techniques by the end of Q4 2025.,2025-12-31,one-time,No,Not Started,,,

Properly designed and implemented multi-factor authentication methods are more reliable and stronger fraud deterrents and are more difficult to compromise. The key objectives of multi-factor authentication are to protect the confidentiality of payment data as well as enhance confidence in digital payment by combating various cyber-attack mechanisms like phishing, keylogging, spyware/malware and other internet-based frauds targeted at REs and their customers. In this regard, - 34.a The implementation of appropriate authentication methodologies should be based on an assessment of the risk posed by the RE’s digital payment products and services. The risk should be evaluated in light of the type of customer (e.g., retail/corporate/commercial); the customer transactional requirements/pattern (e.g., bill payment, fund transfer), the sensitivity of customer information and the volume, value of transactions involved. - 34.b Beyond the technology factor, the success of a particular authentication method depends on appropriate policies, procedures, and controls. An effective authentication method should take into consideration customer acceptance, ease of use, reliable performance, scalability to accommodate growth, customer profile, location, transaction, etc., and interoperability with other systems. - 34.c To enhance online processing security, multi-factor authentication and alerts (like SMS, e-mail, etc.) should be applied in respect of all payment transactions (including debits and credits), creation of new account linkages (addition/modification/deletion of beneficiaries), changing account details or revision to fund transfer limits. In devising these security features, REs should take into account their efficacy and differing customer preferences for additional online protection. - 34.d The alerts and OTPs received by the customer for online transactions shall identify the merchant name, wherever applicable, rather than the payment aggregator through which the transaction was effected. - 34.e As an integral part of the multi-factor authentication architecture, REs should also implement appropriate measures to minimise exposure to a middleman attack which is more commonly known as a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), man-in-the-browser (MITB) attack or man-in-the-application attack. This is to ensure, among other things, that the data in transit is secured and the transactions are authenticated only by genuine/authorised source/process. - 34.f An authenticated session, together with its encryption protocol, should remain intact throughout the interaction with the customer. Else, in the event of interference or in case the customer closes the application, the session should be terminated, and the affected transactions resolved or reversed out.
