Operational_Resilience_20250526140319_ffd98c59-32b1-4d29-9f18-69dba4f77cd8,Main Document,1,Purpose,"- 1.1 Operational Risk is inherent in all banking/ financial products, services, activities, processes, and systems. - 1.2 An operational disruption can threaten the viability of an RE, impact its customers and other market participants, and ultimately have an impact on financial stability. - 1.3 An RE needs to factor in the entire gamut of risks... - 1.4 Until recently, the predominant Operational Risks that REs faced emanated from vulnerabilities related to increasing dependence and rapid adoption of technology... - 1.5 In view of the foregoing, the Reserve Bank, through this Guidance Note intends to: - 1.5.1 promote and further improve the effectiveness of Operational Risk Management... - 1.5.2 enhance their Operational Resilience... - 1.6 This Guidance Note updates the “Guidance Note on Management of Operational Risk” dated October 14, 2005... - 1.7 The Guidance Note has adopted a principle-based and proportionate approach... - 1.8 The operational risk regulatory capital requirements shall continue to be guided by the applicable guidelines.",The Guidance Note aims to enhance the effectiveness of Operational Risk Management and resilience in regulated entities (REs) amid increasing technological vulnerabilities.,Review and implement updated operational risk management practices as per the Guidance Note.,N/A,N/A,No,Not Started,,"**  
The ""Guidance Note on Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience"" issued by the Reserve Bank of India serves to enhance the operational risk management (ORM) practices and resilience of Regulated Entities (REs). This document underscores that operational risk is inherent across banking and financial services and outlines a comprehensive framework for managing these risks, especially in light of increasing reliance on technology and third-party providers. Effective operational risk management is deemed crucial for preserving the viability of REs, safeguarding customer interests, and contributing to financial stability.

The guidance is structured around the necessity for REs to prepare, protect, and adapt to potential disruptions through three main pillars: ""Prepare and Protect,"" ""Build Resilience,"" and ""Learn and Adapt."" It promotes a proactive approach towards risk assessment using tools such as self-assessments, event data collection, scenario analysis, and change management processes. The document establishes that senior management and the Board of Directors must champion a risk-aware culture and maintain a robust governance structure to oversee ORM activities.

Specific sections detail required organizational frameworks, including the three lines of defense model: (1) Business Unit Management, (2) Independent Operational Risk Management, and (3) Audit Functions. These layers are designed to ensure that risks are identified, managed, and monitored effectively across the organization. Additionally, the guidance emphasizes the importance of business continuity planning and third-party dependency management in maintaining operational resilience, especially during crises like pandemics or cyber threats.

Crucially, the document mandates that REs document their operational risk management frameworks, define risk appetites, and develop strategies that include testing their resilience through exercises that mimic real-life disruptions.

**","**  
- Review and update the current Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF) to align with the new guidance, articulating clear roles across all lines of defense.  
- Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment and scenario analysis to identify vulnerabilities in critical operations and establish risk tolerance levels.  
- Implement a robust business continuity plan and conduct exercises to investigate the organization’s ability to remain operational during disruptions.  
- Develop and apply a third-party risk management strategy that includes due diligence and monitoring for all critical vendor relationships.  
- Regularly train staff on operational resilience, ORM practices, and the importance of reporting incidents, including near misses.  
- Establish formal processes for lessons learned after disruptions to continuously refine and improve operational resilience strategies.  
- Ensure the Senior Management and Board are involved in the ORM governance structure, conducting regular reviews of the effectiveness of these practices."
