The document consists of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Master Direction on Outsourcing of Information Technology Services issued in April 2023, effective from October 1, 2023. Its primary goal is to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework governing the outsourcing of IT services by regulated entities (REs), encompassing commercial banks, co-operative banks, non-banking financial companies, and other financial institutions. 

The document underscores the need for REs to adopt strong governance measures to mitigate risks associated with outsourcing, ensuring that such arrangements do not hamper their ability to meet customer obligations or impede RBI's supervisory functions. Key requirements highlighted in the guidelines include the board's responsibility in the approval of outsourcing policies, the establishment of robust risk management frameworks, and mandates for continuous monitoring and evaluation of outsourced services. 

The document elaborates on various elements such as the necessity for a comprehensive IT outsourcing policy, thorough due diligence when engaging service providers, and the importance of having legally binding agreements that define the responsibilities of all parties involved. Furthermore, it emphasizes maintaining data confidentiality, ensuring business continuity and disaster recovery, and developing effective grievance redressal mechanisms for customers. Specific guidelines for monitoring arrangements, creating inventories of outsourced services, and addressing issues related to cross-border outsourcing are detailed to provide clarity and compliance assurance. 

The concluding sections stress the need for a well-defined exit strategy for outsourcing agreements to ensure smooth transitions in case of termination, including data handling protocols. 

**","**
