Operational_Resilience_20250527181643_8fb480c3-1414-4f6c-b286-5e45a4ba335c,Main Document,1,Purpose,"- 1.1 Operational Risk is inherent in all banking/ financial products, services, activities, processes, and systems. Effective management of Operational Risk is an integral part of the Regulated Entities’ (REs) risk management framework. Sound Management of Operational Risk shows the overall effectiveness of the Board of Directors and Senior Management in administering the RE’s portfolio of products, services, activities, processes, and systems. - 1.2 An operational disruption can threaten the viability of an RE, impact its customers and other market participants, and ultimately have an impact on financial stability. It can result from man-made causes, Information Technology (IT) threats (e.g., cyber-attacks, changes in technology, technology failures, etc), geopolitical conflicts, business disruptions, internal/external frauds, execution/ delivery errors, third party dependencies, or natural causes (e.g., climate change, pandemic, etc.). - 1.3 An RE needs to factor in the entire gamut of risks (including the aforesaid risks in its risk assessment policies/ processes), identify and assess them using appropriate tools, monitor its material operational exposures and devise appropriate risk mitigation/management strategies using strong internal controls to minimize operational disruptions and continue to deliver critical operations, thus ensuring operational resilience. - 1.4 Until recently, the predominant Operational Risks that REs faced emanated from vulnerabilities related to increasing dependence and rapid adoption of technology for provision of financial services and intermediation. However, the financial sector’s growing reliance on third-party providers (including technology service providers) exacerbated by Covid-19 pandemic with greater reliance on virtual working arrangements, has highlighted the increasing importance of Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience; which not only benefits the RE by strengthening its ability to remain a viable going concern but also supports the financial system by ensuring continuous delivery of critical operations during any disruption. - 1.5 In view of the foregoing, the Reserve Bank, through this Guidance Note on Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience (hereafter ‘Guidance Note’) intends to: - 1.5.1 promote and further improve the effectiveness of Operational Risk Management of the REs, and - 1.5.2 enhance their Operational Resilience given the interconnections and interdependencies, within the financial system, that result from the complex and dynamic environment in which the REs operate. - 1.6 This Guidance Note updates the “Guidance Note on Management of Operational Risk” dated October 14, 2005. It has been prepared based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) principles documents issued in March 2021, viz., (a) ‘Revisions to the Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk’ and (b) ‘Principles for Operational Resilience’ as well as some of the international best practices. - 1.7 The Guidance Note has adopted a principle-based and proportionate approach to ensure smooth implementation across REs of various sizes, nature, complexity, geographic location and risk profile of their businesses. Although the exact approach may vary from RE to RE, the Guidance Note provides overarching guidance to REs for improving and further strengthening their Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF). It gives adequate flexibility to REs for Operational Risk Management to enhance their ability to withstand, adapt and recover from potential operational disruptions and ensure their Operational Resilience. The systems, procedures and tools prescribed in this Guidance Note are indicative in nature and should be read in conjunction with the relevant instructions issued by Reserve Bank from time to time. In case of inconsistency, if any, the relevant instructions issued by the Reserve Bank would prevail. - 1.8 The operational risk regulatory capital requirements shall continue to be guided by the applicable guidelines.",The Guidance Note aims to enhance Operational Risk Management and Resilience for Regulated Entities (REs) by providing principles-based guidance tailored to different operational contexts.,Review and implement the updated principles on Operational Risk Management and Resilience as outlined in the Guidance Note.,N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,,"**  
The ""Guidance Note on Operational Risk Management and Operational Resilience"" issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) aims to enhance the effectiveness of operational risk management (ORM) among regulated entities (REs) such as commercial banks, cooperative banks, and non-banking financial companies. This guidance, which updates the previous guidance from 2005, emphasizes the importance of sound management practices in the face of increasing operational risks exacerbated by technology dependence and recent global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The document outlines key obligations for REs, including the establishment of a robust operational risk management framework, identification and mitigation of operational risks, effective governance, and fostering a culture of risk awareness. It underscores the necessity for entities to prepare for, withstand, and adapt to operational disruptions, ensuring continuity of critical operations. The guidance is structured around three pillars: Prepare and Protect, Build Resilience, and Learn and Adapt.

Key components include: 
1. **Three Lines of Defence Model:** Outlines a structure of accountability through business unit management (first line), organizational ORM function (second line), and audit function (third line) to ensure comprehensive risk oversight.
2. **Governance and Risk Culture:** Emphasizes strong leadership from the Board of Directors and senior management to create a risk-aware culture and effective operational risk management strategies.
3. **Risk Identification and Assessment:** Encourages REs to employ various tools for identifying and assessing risks, including self-assessments and scenario analyses.
4. **Business Continuity Planning:** Mandates the establishment of business continuity plans (BCPs) that address potential disruptions and incorporate disaster recovery strategies.
5. **Incident Management and Feedback Mechanisms:** Requires ongoing learning through incident management and lessons learned exercises to continuously improve operational resilience.

The guidance also highlights the significance of managing third-party dependencies and emphasizes periodic reviews of operational resilience strategies to adapt to evolving challenges.

**","**  
- Develop and implement a comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF) aligned with the guidance, ensuring it includes a clear structure of three lines of defence.
- Establish a robust governance framework where the Board approves and periodically reviews the ORM and operational resilience strategies.
- Implement a business continuity plan with scenario analyses to prepare for a range of serious disruptions affecting critical operations.
- Conduct regular incident management exercises to assess and improve response strategies based on lessons learned from past incidents.
- Ensure all third-party arrangements undergo thorough risk assessment and compliance checks as part of the ORM framework."

Operational_Resilience_20250527181643_8fb480c3-1414-4f6c-b286-5e45a4ba335c,Main Document,1,Preliminary,"- 1.1 Introduction - 1.1.1 The global financial crisis greatly impacted financial stability around the world. Given the fact that the effects of crisis were much more severe than all the scenarios envisaged by banks as part of their stress tests, several structural changes were undertaken to strengthen banks’/financial institutions’ financial resilience. Though capital and liquidity requirements have improved the ability of banks to absorb shocks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) was of the view that more work needs to be done in the area of Operational Risk Management to provide additional safeguards to the financial system. - 1.1.2 The BCBS recognized Operational Risk as a distinct class of risk in 2001, outside of credit and market risks and came out with Sound Practices for Management and Supervision of Operational Risk in 2003. Subsequently, these principles were revised in 2011, to incorporate the lessons learnt from the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-09. In 2014, a review of the implementation of these Principles was carried out to assess the extent to which banks had implemented these Principles, identify significant gaps, if any, in their implementation and highlight emerging and noteworthy Operational Risk Management practices at banks which may be included in the Principles. It was also observed that several Principles have not yet been adequately implemented, and there was a need for further guidance to facilitate their implementation in areas such as risk identification and assessment tools, key risk indicators, business process mapping, monitoring of action plans, change management programmes and processes, implementation of the three lines of defence, oversight by Board of Directors and Senior Management, articulation of Operational Risk appetite and tolerance statements, risk disclosures, etc. BCBS also recognised that the 2011 Principles did not adequately capture certain important sources of Operational Risk, such as those arising from Information and Communication Technology (ICT) risk. - 1.1.3 Subsequently, the onset of Covid-19 pandemic created disruptions affecting information systems, personnel, facilities, relationships with third-party service providers and customers. It altered the way banks operated in view of their increased demands on technology given the greater reliance on virtual working arrangements. In addition, incidents of cyber threats (ransomware attacks, phishing, etc.) spiked, and the likelihood for materialising of the Operational Risk events caused by people, failed processes, and systems increased, which tested the operational resilience of banks. - 1.1.4 In light of the same, BCBS felt that further work was necessary to strengthen banks’ ability to withstand Operational Risk related events such as pandemics, cyber incidents, technology failures and natural disasters which could cause significant operational failures or widespread disruptions in financial markets. It is in this backdrop, that BCBS came out with updated ‘Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk’ in 2021. Additionally, it also came out with ‘Principles on Operational Resilience’ to enhance the ability of banks to withstand, adapt to and recover from potential hazards.","The BCBS recognized the necessity for enhanced Operational Risk Management following the financial crisis and pandemics, publishing updated principles in 2021 to fortify banks against various operational risks.",Review and implement the updated ‘Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk’ and ‘Principles on Operational Resilience’ by aligning with the latest guidance provided.,N/A,N/A,No,Not Started,,,
Operational_Resilience_20250527181643_8fb480c3-1414-4f6c-b286-5e45a4ba335c,Main Document,2,Definitions,"- 2.1 “Business unit” is responsible for identifying and managing the risks inherent in the products, services, activities, processes and systems for which it is accountable and includes all associated support, corporate and/or shared service functions, e.g., Finance, Human Resources, and Operations and Technology. It does not include Risk Management and Internal Audit functions unless otherwise specifically indicated. - 2.2 “Critical operations” refers to critical functions, activities, processes, services and their relevant supporting assets the disruption of which would be material to the continued operation of the RE or its role in the financial system. Whether a particular operation is “critical” depends on the nature of the RE and its role in the financial system. REs’ tolerance for disruption should be applied at the critical operations level. - 2.3 “Event management” is the process of identification, analysis, end-to-end management and reporting of an operational risk event that follows a pre-determined set of protocols. - 2.4 “Incidents” are current or past disruptive events the occurrence of which would have an adverse effect on critical operations of the RE. Incident management is the process of identifying, analysing, rectifying and learning from an incident (including a cyber incident) and preventing recurrences or mitigating the severity thereof. The goal of incident management is to limit the disruption and restore critical operations in line with the RE’s risk tolerance for disruption. - 2.5 “Information and Communication Technology” refers to the underlying physical and logical design of information technology and communication systems, the individual hardware and software components, data, and the operating environment - 2.6 “Mapping” is the process of identifying, documenting, and understanding the chain of activities involved in delivering critical operations. It incorporates the identification of all interdependencies and interconnections including people, processes, technology and third parties. - 2.7 “Operational resilience” means the ability of an RE to deliver critical operations through disruption. This ability enables an RE to identify and protect itself from threats and potential failures, respond and adapt to, as well as recover and learn from disruptive events to minimise their impact on the delivery of critical operations through disruption. In considering its operational resilience, an RE should assume that disruptions will occur, and take into account its overall risk appetite and tolerance for disruption or impact tolerance. - 2.8 “Operational Risk” means the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. It includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk and it is inherent in all banking/ financial products, activities, processes and systems. - 2.9 “Operational Risk Management” refers to entire gamut of activities right from risk identification, measurement and assessment, monitoring and control, mitigation, reporting to senior management and the Board of Directors on the RE’s risk exposures, Business Continuity Management, and learning through feedback for improvement. - 2.10 “Operational Risk profiles” describe the Operational Risk exposures and control environment assessments of business units of REs and it considers the range of potential impacts that could arise from estimates of expected to plausible severe losses. - 2.11 “Regulated Entities” (REs) refers to the entities mentioned below: - 2.11.1 All Commercial Banks; - 2.11.2 All Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks/State Co-operative Banks/ Central Co-operative Banks; - 2.11.3 All All-India Financial Institutions (viz., Exim Bank, NABARD, NHB, SIDBI, and NaBFID); and - 2.11.4 All Non-Banking Financial Companies including Housing Finance Companies. - 2.12 “Respective functions” refers to the appropriate function(s) within the RE’s three lines of defence, which are (i) business unit management; (ii) an independent Operational Risk Management including Compliance function; and (iii) audit function. - 2.13 “Risk appetite” is the aggregate level and types of risk an RE is willing to assume, decided in advance and within its risk capacity, to achieve its strategic objectives and business plan. - 2.14 “Risk tolerance” is the variation around the prescribed risk appetite that the RE is willing to tolerate. - 2.15 “Supervisory Authority” means, - 2.15.1 Reserve Bank of India in case of Commercial Banks (including Local Area Banks, Payments Banks, Small Finance Banks, and Primary Urban Co-operative Banks), Non-Banking Financial Companies, and All India Financial Institutions. - 2.15.2 National Bank For Agriculture And Rural Development (NABARD) in case of State Co-operative Banks, Central Co-operative Banks, and Regional Rural Banks. - 2.15.3 National Housing Bank (NHB) in case of Housing Finance Companies. - 2.16 “Tolerance for disruption or Impact Tolerance” is the level of disruption from any type of Operational Risk an RE is willing to accept given a range of severe but plausible scenarios.","This section provides definitions related to operational risk, including key terms like ""regulated entities"", ""risk appetite"", and ""operational resilience"" that are essential for understanding compliance obligations within financial operations.",Ensure all relevant personnel are familiar with these definitions and incorporate them into operational procedures and risk management frameworks.,N/A,N/A,No,Not Started,,,
Operational_Resilience_20250527181643_8fb480c3-1414-4f6c-b286-5e45a4ba335c,Main Document,3,Three lines of defence for management of Operational Risk,"- 3.1 Sound internal governance forms the foundation of an effective ORMF. The Operational Risk governance function of REs should be fully integrated into their overall risk management governance structure. REs may leverage their existing risk management functions for this purpose. - 3.2 As a part of their ORMF, REs shall rely on three lines of defence: - 3.2.1 First line of Defence - 3.2.1.1 Business Unit Management typically forms the first line of defence. Sound Operational Risk governance recognises that business unit management is responsible for identifying and managing the risks inherent in the products, services, activities, processes and systems for which it is accountable. REs should have a policy that defines clear roles and responsibilities of relevant business units. The responsibilities of an effective first line of defence in promoting a sound Operational Risk Management culture should include: - (i) Identifying and assessing the materiality of Operational Risks inherent in their respective business units through the use of Operational Risk Management tools; - (ii) Establishing appropriate controls to mitigate inherent Operational Risks, and assessing the design and effectiveness of these controls through the use of the Operational Risk Management tools; - (iii) Reporting whether the business units lack adequate resources, tools and training to ensure identification and assessment of Operational Risks; - (iv) Monitoring and reporting the business units’ Operational Risk profiles, and ensuring their adherence to the established Operational Risk appetite and tolerance statement; and - (v) Reporting residual Operational Risks not mitigated by controls, including operational loss events, control deficiencies, process inadequacies, and non-compliance with Operational Risk tolerances. - 3.2.2 Second line of defence - 3.2.2.1 A functionally independent Organisational Operational Risk Management Function (OORF) forms the second line of defence. The responsibilities of an effective second line of defence in promoting a sound Operational Risk Management culture should include: - (i) Developing an independent view regarding business units’ (a) identified material Operational Risks, (b) design and effectiveness of key controls, and (c) risk tolerance; - (ii) Challenging the relevance and consistency of the business unit’s implementation of the Operational Risk Management tools, measurement activities and reporting systems, and providing evidence of this effective challenge; - (iii) Developing and maintaining Operational Risk Management and measurement policies, standards and guidelines; - (iv) Reviewing and contributing to the monitoring and reporting of the Operational Risk profile; and - (v) Designing and providing Operational Risk training and instilling risk awareness. - 3.2.2.2 At smaller REs (i.e., NBFC-Base Layer and Tier 1 & 2 Co-operative Banks for the purpose of this Guidance Note), if functions of both first and second line of defence are carried out by the same unit, independence may be achieved through separation of duties (with documented policies and processes emphasizing the same) and an independent review of processes and functions. In larger REs (i.e., REs other than the smaller REs), the OORF should have a reporting structure independent of the risk-generating business units and be responsible for the design, maintenance and ongoing development of the ORMF within the RE. The OORF typically engages relevant corporate control groups (e.g., Legal, Finance and IT) as well as the overall Risk Management Function of the RE, to support its assessment of the Operational Risks and controls. REs should have a policy which clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of the OORF, reflective of the size and complexity of the organisation. - 3.2.3 Third line of defence - The third line of defence, i.e the audit function provides an independent assurance to the Board regarding the appropriateness of RE’s ORMF. This function’s staff should not be involved in the development, implementation and operation of Operational Risk Management processes which has been carried out by the other two lines of defence. The third line of defence reviews are generally carried out by RE’s internal and/or external audit but may also involve suitably qualified independent third parties. The scope and frequency of reviews should not only be sufficient to cover all activities and legal entities of an RE, aligned with the RE's Operational Risk profile, and identify and prioritize key risk areas that warrant thorough examination but also be responsive to the dynamic nature of the Operational Risk environment. An effective independent review includes two processes: - 3.2.3.1 Validation - Ensuring that the quantification systems used by the RE are sufficiently robust as (i) they provide assurance about the integrity of inputs, assumptions, processes and methodologies and (ii) results in assessment of Operational Risk that credibly reflects the Operational Risk profile of the RE; - 3.2.3.2 Verification - (i) Review of the design and implementation of the Operational Risk Management systems (including compliance and consistency with Board policies) and associated governance processes through the first and second lines of defence (including the independence of the second line of defence); - (ii) Review of validation processes to ensure they are independent and implemented in a manner consistent with established RE policies; - (iii) Ensuring that business units’ management promptly, accurately and adequately responds to the issues raised, and regularly reports to the Board of Directors or its relevant Committees on pending and closed issues; - (iv) Identifying gaps, if any, in the ORMF and reporting to the Board or its relevant Committee; and - (v) Providing opinion on the overall adequacy and appropriateness of the ORMF and the associated governance processes across the RE by assessing whether the ORMF meets organisational needs and expectations (such as in respect of the risk appetite and tolerance, and adjustment of the framework to changing circumstances). - 3.3 REs should ensure that each line of defence: - 3.3.1 has clearly defined roles and responsibilities; - 3.3.2 is adequately resourced in terms of budget, tools and staff; - 3.3.3 is continuously and adequately trained; - 3.3.4 promotes a sound operational risk management culture across the organisation; and - 3.3.5 communicates with the other lines of defence to reinforce the ORMF. - 3.4 The seamless collaboration between these lines of defence can form a formidable shield, safeguarding not only individual REs but the entire financial system against potential threats and vulnerabilities.","Organizations must establish a robust Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF) that includes three lines of defense, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities to manage and mitigate operational risks effectively.","Define and document the roles and responsibilities for each line of defense, ensuring adequate resources and training are provided.",N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,
Operational_Resilience_20250527181643_8fb480c3-1414-4f6c-b286-5e45a4ba335c,Main Document,4,Governance and Risk Culture,"- Principle 1- The Board of Directors should take the lead in establishing a strong risk management culture, implemented by Senior Management. The Board of Directors and Senior Management should establish a corporate culture guided by strong risk management, set standards and incentives for professional and responsible behaviour, and ensure that staff receives appropriate risk management and ethics training. - 4.1 REs with a strong culture of risk management and ethical business practices are less likely to experience damaging Operational Risk events and are better placed to effectively deal with those events that occur. The actions of the Board of Directors and Senior Management as well as the RE’s risk management policies, processes and systems provide the foundation for a sound risk management culture. - 4.2 The Board of Directors should establish a code of conduct or an ethics policy to address conduct risk. This code or policy should be applicable to both staff and Board members. It should set clear expectations for integrity and ethical values of the highest standard, identify acceptable business practices, and prohibit conflicts of interest or the inappropriate provision of financial services (whether wilful or negligent). It should be regularly reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors and attested by employees. Its implementation should be overseen by a senior ethics committee, or another Board-level committee, and should be publicly available (e.g., on the RE’s website, branch premises). A separate code of conduct may be established for specific positions in the RE (e.g., treasury dealers etc.). - 4.3 Senior Management should set clear expectations and define accountabilities to ensure RE’s staff understand their roles and responsibilities of risk management, as well as their authority to act. - 4.4 Compensation policies should be aligned to the RE’s statement of risk appetite and tolerance as well as overall soundness of risk management framework, and appropriately balance risk and reward. Inappropriate incentives may result in increased litigation, reputational risk, or other risks to the RE. Therefore, the RE should review whether its existing governance and controls are adequate in light of risks arising from incentive arrangements. - 4.5 Senior Management should ensure that an appropriate level of Operational Risk training is available at all levels throughout the organisation, such as heads of business units, heads of internal controls and senior managers. Training provided should reflect the seniority, role and responsibilities of the individuals for whom it is intended. It should also appropriately include ethics training. - 4.6 Strong and consistent support of the Board of Directors and Senior Management for operational risk management coupled with ethical behaviour convincingly reinforce codes of conduct and ethics, compensation strategies, etc. - Principle 2- REs should develop, implement and maintain an ORMF that is fully integrated into the RE’s overall risk management processes. The ORMF adopted by an individual RE will depend on a range of factors, including its nature, size, complexity and risk profile. Further, REs should utilize their existing governance structure to establish, oversee and implement an effective operational resilience approach that enables them to respond and adapt to, as well as recover and learn from, disruptive events in order to minimise their impact on delivering critical operations through disruption. - 4.7 The Board of Directors and Senior Management of RE should understand the nature and complexity of the risks inherent in the portfolio of RE’s new business initiatives, products, services, activities, processes, and systems, which is a fundamental premise of sound risk management. This is particularly important for Operational Risk, as it is inherent in all business products, services, activities, processes, and systems. - 4.8 The components of the ORMF should be fully integrated into the overall risk management processes of the RE by the first line of defence, adequately challenged and reviewed by the second line of defence, and independently reviewed by the third line of defence. The ORMF should be embedded across all levels of the RE including group and business units as well as new business initiatives, products, services, activities, processes, and systems. In addition, results of the RE’s Operational Risk assessment should be incorporated into the RE’s overall business strategy development process. The overall approach to ORMF should reflect the following: - 4.8.1 Management of Operational Risk is embedded within business lines of an RE. - 4.8.2 Senior managers are responsible for management and ownership of Operational Risk across RE’s end-to-end processes. - 4.8.3 Board is ultimately responsible and accountable for oversight of Operational Risk Management. - 4.9 The ORMF should be comprehensively and appropriately documented in Board of Directors approved policies and include definitions of Operational Risk and operational loss. If REs do not adequately describe and classify Operational Risk and loss exposure, it would result in significantly reducing the effectiveness of their ORMF. - 4.10 ORMF documentation should clearly: - 4.10.1 identify the governance structures used to manage Operational Risk, including reporting lines and accountabilities, and the mandates and membership of the Operational Risk governance committees; - 4.10.2 reference the relevant Operational Risk Management policies and procedures; - 4.10.3 describe the tools for risk and control identification and assessment and the role and responsibilities of the three lines of defence in using them; - 4.10.4 describe the RE’s accepted Operational Risk appetite and tolerance; the thresholds, material activity triggers or limits for inherent and residual risk; and the approved risk mitigation strategies and instruments; - 4.10.5 describe the RE’s approach to ensure controls are designed, implemented and operate effectively; - 4.10.6 describe the RE’s approach to establishing and monitoring thresholds or limits for inherent and residual risk exposure; - 4.10.7 describe inventory risks and controls implemented by all business units (e.g., in a control library); - 4.10.8 establish risk reporting and management information systems (MIS) for producing timely, and accurate data; - 4.10.9 provide for a common taxonomy of Operational Risk terms to ensure consistency of risk identification, exposure rating and risk management objectives across all business units. The taxonomy can distinguish Operational Risk exposures by event types, causes, materiality and business units where they occur; it can also flag those operational risk exposures that partially or entirely represent legal, conduct, model and ICT (including cyber) risks as well as exposures in the credit or market risk boundary; - 4.10.10 provide for appropriate independent review and challenge of the outcomes of the risk management process; and - 4.10.11 require the policies to be reviewed and revised as appropriate based on continued assessment of the quality of the control environment addressing internal and external environmental changes or whenever a material change in the Operational Risk profile of the RE occurs.","The Board of Directors and Senior Management must establish a strong risk management culture, implement an Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF), and ensure ongoing training and ethical standards for all staff, with regular reviews and clear accountability.","Develop and implement a comprehensive ORMF that includes clear governance, accountability, and training protocols, and ensure it is publicly available.",2025-11-27,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,
Operational_Resilience_20250527181643_8fb480c3-1414-4f6c-b286-5e45a4ba335c,Main Document,5,Responsibilities of Board of Directors and Senior Management,"- Principle 3- The Board of Directors should approve and periodically review the ORMF and Operational Resilience approach, and ensure that Senior Management implements the policies, processes and systems of the ORMF and Operational Resilience approach effectively at all decision levels. - 5.1 The Board of Directors should: - 5.1.1 establish a risk management culture and ensure that the RE has adequate processes for understanding the nature and scope of the Operational Risk inherent in its current and planned strategies and activities; - 5.1.2 ensure that the Operational Risk Management processes are subject to comprehensive and dynamic oversight and are fully integrated into, or coordinated with, the overall framework for managing all risks across the enterprise; - 5.1.3 provide senior management with clear guidance regarding the principles underlying the ORMF, and approve the corresponding policies developed by senior management to align with these principles; - 5.1.4 regularly review and evaluate the effectiveness of, and approve the ORMF to ensure the RE has identified and is managing the Operational Risk arising from external market changes and other environmental factors, as well as those Operational Risks associated with new products, services, activities, processes or systems, including changes in risk profiles and priorities (e.g. changing business volumes); - 5.1.5 ensure that the RE’s ORMF is subject to effective independent review by a third line of defence (audit or other appropriately trained independent third parties from external sources); and - 5.1.6 ensure that, as best practices evolve, management is availing themselves of these advances. - 5.2 Strong internal controls are a critical aspect of Operational Risk Management. The Board of Directors should establish clear lines of management responsibility and accountability for implementing a strong control environment. Controls should be regularly reviewed, monitored, and tested to ensure its ongoing effectiveness. The control environment should provide appropriate independence/separation of duties between Operational Risk Management functions, business units and support functions. - 5.3 The Board of Directors should review and approve the RE’s Operational Resilience approach considering the RE’s risk appetite and tolerance for disruption to its critical operations. In formulating the RE’s tolerance for disruption, the Board of Directors should consider its operational capabilities given a broad range of severe but plausible scenarios that would affect its critical operations. The Board of Directors should ensure that the RE’s policies effectively address instances where the RE’s capabilities are insufficient to meet its stated tolerance for disruption. - 5.4 The Board of Directors should take an active role in establishing a broad understanding of the RE’s operational resilience approach, through clear communication of its objectives to all relevant parties, including the RE’s personnel, third parties, and intra-group entities. - 5.5 Under the oversight of the Board of Directors, Senior Management should implement the RE’s operational resilience approach and ensure that financial, technical, and other resources are appropriately allocated in order to support the RE’s overall operational resilience approach. - Principle 4- The Board of Directors should approve and periodically review a risk appetite and tolerance statement for Operational Risk that articulates the nature, types and levels of Operational Risk the RE is willing to assume. The Board of Directors should also review and approve the criteria for identification and classification as critical operations as well as of impact tolerances for each critical operation, in order to enhance RE’s Operational Resilience. - 5.6 The risk appetite and tolerance statement for Operational Risk should be developed under the authority of the Board of Directors and linked to the RE’s short and long-term strategic and financial plans. Taking into account the interests of the RE’s customers and stakeholders as well as regulatory requirements, an effective risk appetite and tolerance statement should: - 5.6.1 be easy to communicate and easy to understand for all stakeholders; - 5.6.2 include key background information and assumptions that informed the RE’s business plans at the time of its approval; - 5.6.3 include statements that clearly articulate the motivation(s) for taking on or avoiding certain types of risk, and establish boundaries or indicators (which may be quantitative or not) to enable monitoring of these risks; - 5.6.4 ensure that the strategy and risk limits of business units and legal entities, as relevant, align with the RE-wide risk appetite statement; and - 5.6.5 be forward-looking and, where applicable, subject to scenario and stress testing to ensure that the RE understands what events might push it outside its risk appetite and tolerance statement. - 5.7 The starting point for an RE in enhancing its operational resilience is to set the criteria for defining its critical operations. The Board of Directors should approve clearly defined and documented criteria to determine how operations are classified as critical. The criteria should enable an RE to identify its critical operations and prioritise them in the event of a disruption. This should be achieved by considering the risk a disruption poses to its customers, the RE’s viability, safety and soundness, and overall financial stability. The criteria for the identification of critical operations should be reviewed and approved by the Board annually or at the time of implementing material changes to the business that would involve additional critical operations. - 5.8 The Board of Directors should review and approve impact tolerances for each critical operation at least annually or as and when a disruption occurs. The purpose of impact tolerance is to quantify the maximum acceptable level of disruption for each critical operation. It needs to be tested against severe but plausible scenarios to determine their appropriateness, i.e., to determine whether the RE is able to stay within the defined impact tolerances during a disruption. - 5.9 An RE should set at least one impact tolerance metric for each of its critical operations. At a minimum, there should be a (a) time-based metric (e.g., maximum acceptable duration a critical operation can withstand a disruption), (b) quantity-based metric (e.g., maximum extent of data loss that an RE would accept as a result of disruption) and (c) service level metric (e.g., minimum level of service that an RE would maintain while operating under alternative arrangements). To further enhance its operational resilience, an RE should consider having additional impact tolerance metrics such as the maximum tolerable number of customers affected by a disruption; maximum number of transactions affected by a disruption; and the maximum value of transactions impacted. - Principle 5- Senior Management should develop for approval by the Board of Directors a clear, effective and robust governance structure with well-defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility. Senior Management is responsible for consistently implementing and maintaining throughout the organisation policies, processes and systems for managing Operational Risk in all of the RE’s material products, activities, processes and systems consistent with its risk appetite and tolerance statement. - 5.10 Senior Management should translate the ORMF approved by the Board of Directors into specific policies and procedures that can be implemented and verified within the different business units. It should clearly assign authority, responsibility and reporting relationships to encourage and maintain accountability, and to ensure the necessary resources are available to manage Operational Risk in line with the RE’s risk appetite and tolerance statement. Moreover, it should also ensure that the management oversight process is appropriate for the risks inherent in a business unit’s activity. - 5.11 Senior Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining robust challenge mechanisms and effective issue resolution processes. These should include systems to report, track, and when necessary, escalate issues to ensure resolution. REs should be able to demonstrate that the three-lines-of-defence approach is operating satisfactorily and to explain how the Board of Directors, independent Audit Committee of the Board, and Senior Management ensure that this approach is implemented and operating in an appropriate manner. - 5.12 Senior Management should ensure that staff responsible for managing Operational Risk coordinate and communicate effectively with staff responsible for managing credit, market, and other risks, as well as with those in the RE who are responsible for the procurement of external services such as insurance risk transfer and other third-party arrangements. Failure to do so could result in significant gaps or overlaps in an RE’s overall risk management programme. - 5.13 The managers of the OORF within the RE should be of sufficient stature to perform their duties effectively, ideally evidenced by a title that is commensurate with other risk management functions such as credit, market and liquidity risk. - 5.14 Senior Management should ensure that RE’s activities are conducted by staff with the necessary experience, technical capabilities and access to resources. The staff responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the RE’s risk policy should have authority independent from the units they oversee. - 5.15 An RE’s governance structure should be commensurate with the nature, size, complexity and risk profile of its activities. When designing the Operational Risk governance structure, an RE should take the following into consideration: - 5.15.1 Committee structure - A sound industry practice for larger and more complex organisations with a central group function and separate business units to utilise a Board-created enterprise-level risk committee for overseeing all risks, to which a management level Operational Risk Committee reports. Depending on the nature, size and complexity of the RE, the enterprise-level risk committee may receive input from Operational Risk committee(s), business or functional area. Smaller and less complex organisations may utilise a flatter organisational structure that oversees Operational Risk directly within the Board’s risk management committee. - 5.15.2 Committee composition - A sound industry practice for Operational Risk committees (or the risk committee in smaller REs) is to include members with a variety of expertise, which should cover expertise in business activities, financial activities, legal, technological and regulatory matters, and risk management. - 5.15.3 Committee operation - Committee meetings should be held at appropriate frequencies with adequate time and resources to permit productive discussion and decision-making. Records of committee operations should be adequate and documented to permit review and evaluation of committee effectiveness. - 5.16 Because Operational Risk Management is an evolving area, and the business environment is constantly changing, Senior Management should ensure that the RE’s policies, processes and systems under ORMF remain sufficiently robust to manage and ensure that operational losses are adequately addressed in a timely manner. Improvements in Operational Risk Management depend heavily on senior management’s willingness to be proactive and also act promptly and appropriately to address Operational Risk managers’ concerns.","The Board of Directors must approve and periodically review the Operational Risk Management Framework (ORMF) and ensure ongoing effectiveness in managing operational risks across all levels, addressing external market changes and resource allocation.","Establish and review the ORMF and Operational Resilience approach, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives and effective communication throughout the organization.",N/A,annual,No,Not Started,,,
Operational_Resilience_20250527181643_8fb480c3-1414-4f6c-b286-5e45a4ba335c,Main Document,6,Risk management environment - Identification and assessment,"- Principle 6: Senior Management should ensure the comprehensive identification and assessment of the Operational Risk inherent in all material products, activities, processes and systems to make sure the inherent risks and incentives are well understood. Both internal and external threats and potential failures in people, processes and systems should be assessed promptly and on an ongoing basis. Assessment of vulnerabilities in critical operations should be done in a proactive and prompt manner. All the resulting risks should be managed in accordance with operational resilience approach. - 6.1 Risk identification and assessment are fundamental characteristics of an effective Operational Risk Management system, and directly contribute to operational resilience capabilities. Effective risk identification considers both internal and external factors. Sound risk assessment allows an RE to better understand its risk profile and allocate risk management resources and strategies most effectively. - 6.2 Examples of tools (indicative and not exhaustive) used for identifying and assessing Operational Risk are: - 6.2.1 Self-assessments - REs often perform self-assessments of their Operational Risks and controls at various levels. The assessments typically evaluate inherent risk (the risk before controls are considered), the effectiveness of the control environment, and residual risk (the risk exposure after controls are considered) and contain both quantitative (such as metrics, benchmarking, etc.) and qualitative (such as likelihood and consequence of the risk event in determination of inherent and residual risk ratings) elements. The assessments may utilise business process mapping to identify key steps in business processes, activities, and organisational functions, as well as the associated risks and areas of control weakness. The assessments should contain sufficiently detailed information on the business environment, Operational Risks, underlying causes, controls and evaluation of control effectiveness to enable an independent reviewer to determine how the RE reached its ratings. A risk register can be maintained to collate this information to form a meaningful view of the overall effectiveness of controls and facilitate oversight by senior management, risk committees, and the Board of Directors. - 6.2.2 Operational Risk event data - REs often maintain a comprehensive Operational Risk event dataset that collects all material events experienced by the RE and serves as basis for Operational Risk assessments. The event dataset typically includes internal loss data, near misses, etc., and is classified according to a taxonomy defined in the ORMF policies and consistently applied across the RE. It also includes the date of the event (occurrence date, discovery date and accounting date) and, in the case of loss events, financial impact. When other root cause information for events is available, ideally it can also be included in the Operational Risk dataset. Where feasible, REs are encouraged to also seek to gather external Operational Risk event data and use this data in their internal analysis, as it is often informative of risks that are common across the industry. - 6.2.3 Event management - A sound event management approach typically includes analysis of events to identify new Operational Risks, understanding the underlying causes and control weaknesses, and formulating an appropriate response to prevent recurrence of similar events. This information is an input to the self-assessment and, in particular, to the assessment of control effectiveness. - 6.2.4 Control monitoring and assurance framework - Incorporating an appropriate control monitoring and assurance framework facilitates a structured approach to the evaluation, review and ongoing monitoring and testing of key controls. The analysis of controls ensures these are suitably designed for the identified risks and are operating effectively. The analysis should also consider the sufficiency of control coverage, including adequate prevention, detection and response strategies. The control monitoring and testing should be appropriate for the different Operational Risks and across business areas. Further details on control and mitigation are given in paragraph 9 of this Guidance Note. - 6.2.5 Metrics - Using Operational Risk event data and risk and control assessments, REs often develop metrics to assess and monitor their Operational Risk exposure. These metrics may be simple indicators, such as event counts, or result from more sophisticated exposure models. Metrics provide early warning information to monitor ongoing performance of the business and the control environment, and to report the Operational Risk profile. Effective metrics clearly link the associated Operational Risks and controls. Monitoring metrics and related trends through time against laid down thresholds or limits or tolerance levels provides valuable information for risk management and reporting purposes. - 6.2.6 Scenario analysis - Scenario analysis is a method to identify, measure and analyse a range of scenarios, including low probability and high severity events, some of which could result in severe Operational Risk losses. It typically involves workshops or meetings of subject matter experts including senior management, business management and senior Operational Risk staff and other functional areas such as compliance, human resources and IT risk management, to develop and analyse the drivers and range of consequences of potential events. Inputs to the scenario analysis would typically include relevant internal and external loss data, information from self-assessments, the control monitoring and assurance framework, forward-looking metrics, root-cause analyses and the process framework. The scenario analysis process could be used to develop a range of consequences of potential events, including impact assessments for risk management purposes, supplementing other tools based on historical data or current risk assessments. An RE must carry out regular scenario analysis using the above parameters, for testing its ability to remain within its impact tolerance in the event disruption of its operations, for each of its critical services. In carrying out the scenario analysis, an RE must identify the range of adverse circumstances of varying nature, severity and duration, relevant to its business and risk profile and consider the risks to delivery of the RE’s critical services in those circumstances. Such an exercise could also be integrated with disaster recovery and business continuity plans, for further testing of operational resilience. Given the subjectivity of the scenario process, a robust governance framework and independent review are important to ensure the integrity and consistency of the process. - 6.2.7 Benchmarking and comparative analysis - Benchmarking and comparative analysis are comparisons of the outcomes of different risk measurement and management tools deployed within the RE, as well as comparisons of metrics of the RE, with other REs in the industry. Such comparisons can be performed to enhance understanding of the RE’s Operational Risk profile. For example, comparing the frequency and severity of internal losses with self-assessments can help the RE determine whether its self-assessment processes are functioning effectively. Scenario analysis data can be compared with internal and external loss data to gain a better understanding of the severity of the RE’s exposure to potential risk events. - 6.3 REs should ensure that the Operational Risk assessment tools’ outputs are: - 6.3.1 based on accurate data, whose integrity is ensured by strong governance and robust verification and validation procedures; - 6.3.2 adequately taking into account the internal pricing and performance measurement mechanisms as well as business opportunities assessments; and - 6.3.3 subject to OORF-monitored action plans or remediation plans when necessary. - 6.4 These Operational Risk assessment tools directly contribute to an RE’s operational resilience approach, in particular event management, self-assessment and scenario analysis procedures, as they allow REs to identify and monitor both internal and external threats and vulnerabilities to their critical operations. REs should use the outputs of these tools on a regular basis and in a timely manner to manage, address and improve their operational resilience controls and procedures so as to prevent them from affecting critical operations delivery. In doing so, the Operational Risk Management function should work alongside other relevant functions. These assessments should also be conducted in the event of changes to any underlying components of the critical operations, as well as after incidents in order to take into account lessons learned and new threats and vulnerabilities, if any, that caused the incident.","Organizations must comprehensively identify and assess operational risks related to all material products, activities, and systems, employing self-assessments and event data to ensure operational resilience and facilitate ongoing risk management.",Conduct thorough and proactive operational risk assessments using diverse tools and methodologies to manage and improve operational resilience controls.,N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,
Operational_Resilience_20250527181643_8fb480c3-1414-4f6c-b286-5e45a4ba335c,Main Document,7,Change Management,"- Principle 7: Senior Management should ensure that the RE’s change management process is comprehensive, appropriately resourced and adequately articulated between the relevant lines of defence. - 7.1 In general, an RE’s Operational Risk exposure evolves when an RE initiates change, such as engaging in new activities or developing new products or services; entering into unfamiliar markets or jurisdictions; implementing new or modifying business processes or technology systems; and/or engaging in businesses that are geographically distant from the Head Office. Change management should assess the evolution of associated risks across time, from inception to termination (e.g. throughout the full life cycle of a product). - 7.2 An RE should have policies and procedures defining the process for identifying, managing, challenging, approving and monitoring change on the basis of agreed objective criteria. Change implementation should be monitored by specific oversight controls. Change management policies and procedures should be subject to independent and regular review and update, and clearly allocate roles and responsibilities in accordance with the three-lines-of-defence model, in particular: - 7.2.1 The first line of defence should perform Operational Risk and control assessments of new products, services, activities, processes and systems, including the identification and evaluation of the required change through the decision-making and planning phases to the implementation of the change and post-implementation review. - 7.2.2 The second line of defence (OORF) should challenge the Operational Risk and control assessments of first line of defence, as well as monitor the implementation of appropriate controls or remediation actions. OORF should cover all phases of this process. In addition, OORF should ensure that all relevant control groups (e.g., finance, compliance, legal, business, ICT, risk management) are involved as appropriate. - 7.2.3 The third line of defence may review the above as per the mandate defined at paragraph 3.2.3. - 7.3 As a part of the change management exercise, an RE should have policies and procedures for the review and approval of new products, services, activities, processes, and systems. The review and approval process should consider: - 7.3.1 Inherent risks - including legal, ICT, and model risks - in the launch of new products, services, activities, and operations in unfamiliar markets, and in the implementation of new processes, people and systems (especially when third party services are used). - 7.3.2 Changes to the RE’s Operational Risk profile, appetite and tolerance, including changes to the risk of existing products or activities, especially critical operations. - 7.3.3 The necessary controls, risk management processes, and risk mitigation strategies. - 7.3.4 The residual risk. - 7.3.5 Changes to relevant risk thresholds or limits. - 7.3.6 The procedures and metrics to assess, monitor, and manage the risk of new products, services, activities, markets, jurisdictions, processes and systems. - 7.4 The review and approval process should include ensuring that appropriate investment has been made for human resources and technology infrastructure before changes are introduced. Changes should be monitored, during and after their implementation, to identify any material differences to the expected Operational Risk profile and manage any unexpected risks.","Senior Management must ensure a comprehensive change management process that includes risk assessment, monitoring, and independent reviews across all lines of defence for new activities and products.","Develop and implement robust policies and procedures for change management, including independent reviews and clear role allocations by 2025-11-27.",2025-11-27,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,

Appropriate reporting mechanisms should be in place at the Board of Directors, Senior Management, and business unit levels to support proactive management of Operational Risk. - 8.1 An RE should ensure that its reports are comprehensive, accurate, consistent and actionable across business units and products. To this end, the first line of defence should ensure reporting on any residual Operational Risks, including Operational Risk events, control deficiencies, process inadequacies, and non-compliance with Operational Risk tolerances. Reports should be manageable in scope and volume by providing an outlook on the RE’s Operational Risk profile and adherence to the Operational Risk appetite and tolerance statement; effective decision-making is impeded by both excessive amounts and paucity of data. - 8.2 Reporting by RE should be timely and should be able to produce reports in both normal and stressed market conditions. The frequency of reporting should reflect the risks involved and the pace and nature of changes in the operating environment. The results of monitoring activities should be included in regular management and Board reports, as should assessments of the ORMF performed by the internal/external audit and/or risk management functions. Reports generated by or for supervisory authorities should also be reported internally to Senior Management and the Board of Directors. - 8.3 Operational Risk reports should describe the Operational Risk profile of the RE by providing internal financial, operational, and compliance indicators, as well as external market or environmental information about events and conditions that are relevant to decision-making. - 8.4 Data capture and risk reporting processes should be analysed periodically with the goal of enhancing risk management performance as well as advancing risk management policies, procedures and practices. - 8.5 Further, Senior Management should provide timely reports to the Board on the ongoing operational resilience of the RE’s business units to support the Board’s oversight, particularly when significant deficiencies could affect the delivery of the RE’s critical operations.","Senior Management must ensure a regular monitoring and reporting process for Operational Risk profiles and exposures, integrating timely, actionable reports across business units and to the Board of Directors.",Establish a systematic reporting process on Operational Risks that includes timely delivery of comprehensive reports to Senior Management and the Board.,N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,
Operational_Resilience_20250527181643_8fb480c3-1414-4f6c-b286-5e45a4ba335c,Main Document,9,Control and Mitigation,"- Principle 9: REs should have a strong control environment that utilises policies, processes and systems; appropriate internal controls; and appropriate risk mitigation and/or transfer strategies. - 9.1 Internal controls should be designed to provide reasonable assurance that an RE will have efficient and effective operations; safeguard its assets; produce reliable financial reports; and comply with applicable laws and regulations. A sound internal control programme consists of four components that are integral to the risk management process: risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring activities. - 9.2 Control processes and procedures should include a system for ensuring compliance with policies, regulations and laws. Examples of principal elements of a policy compliance assessment are: - Examples of principal elements of a policy compliance assessment are: - • Top-level reviews of progress towards stated objectives - • Verification of compliance with management controls - • Review of the treatment and resolution of instances of non-compliance - • Evaluation of the required approvals and authorisations to ensure accountability to an appropriate level of management - • Tracking of reports for approved exceptions to thresholds or limits, management overrides and other deviations from policy, regulations and laws. - 9.3 Controls processes and procedures should address how the RE ensures continuity of operations in both normal circumstances and in the event of disruption, reflecting respective functions’ due diligence, consistent with the RE’s operational resilience approach. - 9.4 An effective control environment also requires appropriate segregation of duties. Assignments that establish conflicting duties for individuals or a team, without dual controls may result in concealment of losses, errors or other inappropriate actions. Therefore, areas where conflicts of interest may arise should be identified, minimised, and be subject to careful monitoring and review. - 9.5 In addition to segregation of duties and dual controls, REs should ensure that other traditional internal controls are in place, as appropriate, to address Operational Risk. Some of the examples of these controls are given in table below: - 9.6 Effective use and sound implementation of technology can contribute to the control environment. For example, automated processes are less prone to error than manual processes. However, automated processes introduce risks that should be addressed through sound technology governance and infrastructure risk management programmes. - 9.7 The use of technology-related products, services, activities, processes and delivery channels exposes an RE to Operational Risk and the possibility of material financial loss. Consequently, an RE should have an integrated approach to identifying, measuring, monitoring and managing technology risks along the same precepts as Operational Risk Management.",REs must establish a strong control environment with effective internal controls and risk management processes to ensure compliance and operational resilience.,"Develop and implement a comprehensive internal control program incorporating risk assessment, control activities, and compliance verification.",N/A,N/A,No,Not Started,,,

Activities such as risk identification and assessment, risk mitigation (including the implementation of controls) and the monitoring of risks and control effectiveness work together to minimise operational disruptions and their effects. The overarching principle of operational resilience is the acceptance that disruptions will occur, and that REs need to be prepared to respond accordingly and have measures in place to limit the impact. The REs need to ensure that they have prepared effectively, and have the flexibility to withstand, absorb, respond, adapt and recover and learn from disruptions with minimal impact on their critical operations. Further, management’s focus on the RE’s ability to respond to and recover from disruptions, assuming failures will occur, will support operational resilience. An operationally resilient RE is less prone to incur untimely lapses in its operations and losses from disruptions, thus lessening impact on critical operations and related services, functions and systems. While it may not be possible to avoid certain Operational Risks, such as a pandemic, it is possible to improve the resilience of an RE’s operations to such events.","Organizations must proactively manage Operational Risks to enhance resilience, ensuring they can effectively respond to and recover from disruptions.","Implement a comprehensive risk management framework to identify, assess, and mitigate Operational Risks.",N/A,ongoing,No,Not Started,,,
