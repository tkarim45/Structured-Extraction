    "            Extract the complete hierarchical structure from the provided text, identifying all chapters, sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and appendices, preserving their original numbering and text. Format the output as pipe-delimited strings with four fields: Chapter, Section No., Section, and Sub-Section. The Sub-Section field should include all nested subsection text (e.g., subsections, sub-subsections) in a hierarchical bullet-point format. If no subsections exist, use an empty string for Sub-Section. Each entry must start with \"Chapter:\". For appendices, treat them as chapters with the format \"Appendix [Number] - [Title]\".\n",

    "\n",
    "            **Knowledge**\n",

    "            - Sections are identified by numbers followed by periods (e.g., '1.', '2.').\n",
    "            - Subsections use labels like 'a)', 'i)', '1.1', etc., and may have deeper levels (e.g., 'i)', 'A)').\n",
    "            - Use context clues (indentation, numbering, content flow) to infer hierarchy if formatting is inconsistent.\n",
    "            - Output format: `Chapter: <chapter or appendix title>|Section No.: <number>|Section: <title>|Sub-Section: <nested subsection text or empty>`\n",
    "            - For Sub-Section, use a bullet-point list with hyphens (e.g., `- a) Text - i) Sub-text`).\n",

The strategy should include exit strategy for different scenarios of exit or termination of services with stipulation of minimum period to execute such plans, as necessary. In documenting an exit strategy, the RE shall, inter alia, identify alternative arrangements, which may include performing the activity by a different service provider or RE itself. - b) REs shall ensure that the agreement has necessary clauses on safe removal/destruction of data, hardware and all records (digital and physical), as applicable. However, service provider shall be legally obliged to cooperate fully with both the RE and new service provider(s) to ensure there is a smooth transition. Further, agreement shall ensure that the service provider is prohibited from erasing, purging, revoking, altering or changing any data during the transition period, unless specifically advised by the regulator/concerned RE.'}, {'Chapter': 'Appendix I - Usage of Cloud Computing Services', 'Section No.': 1, 'Section': 'Usage of Cloud Computing Services', 'Sub-Section': '- There are several cloud deployment and service models that have emerged over time. These are generally based on the extent of technology stack that is proposed to be adopted by the consuming entity. Each of these models come with corresponding service, business benefit and risk profiles. - In addition to the Outsourcing of IT Services controls prescribed in these Directions, REs shall adopt the following requirements for storage, computing and movement of data in cloud environments: - 1. While considering adoption of cloud solution, it is imperative to analyse the business strategy and goals adopted to the current IT applications footprint and associated costs. - 2. In engaging cloud services, REs shall ensure, inter alia, that the Outsourcing of IT Services policy addresses the entire lifecycle of data, i.e., covering the entire span of time from generation of the data, its entry into the cloud, till the data is permanently erased/deleted. The REs shall ensure that the procedures specified are consistent with business needs and legal and regulatory requirements. - 3. In adoption of cloud services, REs shall take into account the cloud service specific factors, viz., multi-tenancy, multi-location storing/processing of data, etc., and attendant risks, while establishing appropriate risk management framework. Cloud security is a shared responsibility between the RE and the Cloud Service Provider.'}, {'Chapter': 'Appendix I - Usage of Cloud Computing Services', 'Section No.': 2, 'Section': 'Cloud Services Management and Security Considerations', 'Sub-Section': '- a) Service and Technology Architecture: REs shall ensure that the service and technology architecture supporting cloud-based applications is built in adherence to globally recognised architecture principles and standards. REs shall prefer a technology architecture that provides for secure container-based data management, where encryption keys and Hardware Security Modules are under the control of the RE. The architecture should provide for a standard set of tools and processes to manage containers, images and releases. Multi-tenancy environments should be protected against data integrity and confidentiality risks, and against co-mingling of data. The architecture should be resilient and enable smooth recovery in case of failure of any one or combination of components across the cloud architecture with minimal impact on data/information security.'}, {'Chapter': 'Appendix II - Outsourcing of Security Operations Centre', 'Section No.': 1, 'Section': 'Applicability to SOC services', 'Sub-Section': '- a) Unambiguously identify the owner of assets used in providing the services (systems, software, source code, processes, concepts, etc.); - b) Ensure that the RE has adequate oversight and ownership over the rule definition, customisation and related data/logs, meta-data and analytics (specific to the RE); - c) Assess SOC functioning, including all physical facilities involved in service delivery, such as the SOC and areas where client data is stored/processed periodically; - d) Integrate the outsourced SOC reporting and escalation process with the RE’s incident response process; - e) Review the process of handling the alerts/events.'}, {'Chapter': 'Appendix III - Services not considered under Outsourcing of IT Services', 'Section No.': 1, 'Section': 'Exclusions from Outsourcing', 'Sub-Section': '- A. Services/Activities not considered under “Outsourcing of IT Services” for the purpose of this Master Direction (an indicative but not exhaustive list): - i) Corporate Internet Banking services obtained by regulated entities as corporate customers/sub members of another regulated entity; - ii) External audit such as Vulnerability Assessment/Penetration Testing (VA/PT), Information Systems Audit, security review; - iii) SMS gateways (Bulk SMS service providers); - iv) Procurement of IT hardware/appliances; - v) Acquisition of IT software/product/application (like CBS, database, security solutions, etc.) on a licence or subscription basis and any enhancements made to such licensed third-party application by its vendor (as upgrades) or on specific change request made by the RE; - vi) Any maintenance service (including security patches, bug fixes) for IT Infra or licensed products, provided by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) themselves, in order to ensure continued usage of the same by the RE; - vii) Applications provided by financial sector regulators or institutions like CCIL, NSE, BSE, etc.; - viii) Platforms provided by entities like Reuters, Bloomberg, SWIFT, etc.; - ix) Any other off the shelf products (like anti-virus software, email solution, etc.) subscribed to by the regulated entity wherein only a license is procured with no/minimal customization; - x) Services obtained by a RE as a sub-member of a Centralised Payment Systems (CPS) from another RE; - xi) Business Correspondent (BC) services, payroll processing, statement printing.'}]\n",
