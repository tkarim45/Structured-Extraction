    "### LLM Prompt for Extracting and Structuring RBI Document into CSV Format\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**:  \n",
    "You are an advanced Large Language Model tasked with processing a raw text file containing the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Master Direction on Outsourcing of Information Technology Services (Reference: RBI/2023-24/102, dated April 10, 2023). Your goal is to extract the relevant content and convert it into a structured CSV format with the following columns: `Chapter`, `Section No.`, `Section`, `Sub-Section`, and `TPM Policy sub point`. The output must exclude the index and appendices (Appendix I, II, III), focus on the introductory section and Chapters I to X, and align with the provided example format. The CSV must handle HTML tags, ensure proper quoting, and assign TPM policy references where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**:  \n",
    "The input is a raw text file containing the full RBI Master Direction document, structured as follows:  \n",
    "- A header with document reference (RBI/2023-24/102), date (April 10, 2023), and recipient details.  \n",
    "- An introductory section explaining the purpose and context of the Directions.  \n",
    "- Ten chapters (I to X), covering:  \n",
    "  - Chapter I: Preliminary (definitions, applicability, commencement).  \n",
    "  - Chapter II: Role of the Regulated Entity (regulatory requirements, assessments).  \n",
    "  - Chapter III: Governance Framework (policies, roles).  \n",
    "  - Chapter IV: Evaluation and Engagement of Service Providers (due diligence).  \n",
    "  - Chapter V: Outsourcing Agreement (legal agreements, clauses).  \n",
    "  - Chapter VI: Risk Management (framework, business continuity).  \n",
    "  - Chapter VII: Monitoring and Control of Outsourced Activities (audits, oversight).  \n",
    "  - Chapter VIII: Outsourcing within a Group / Conglomerate.  \n",
    "  - Chapter IX: Cross-Border Outsourcing.  \n",
    "  - Chapter X: Exit Strategy.  \n",
    "- An index (to be ignored).  \n",
    "- Appendices I, II, and III (to be ignored).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The text may include HTML tags (e.g., `<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">`) for formatting, numbered sections (e.g., 1, 2), subsections (e.g., (a), (b), (i)), and detailed provisions. The content includes regulatory guidelines, definitions, and requirements for Regulated Entities (REs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Processing**:  \n",
    "   - Parse the raw text to identify and extract the main content, including the introductory section and Chapters I to X.  \n",
    "   - Exclude the index and appendices (Appendix I, II, III) from processing, as they are not to be included in the output.  \n",
    "   - Recognize the document hierarchy:  \n",
    "     - Chapters (e.g., \"I - Preliminary\", \"II - Role of the Regulated Entity\").  \n",
    "     - Sections (e.g., \"1. Short Title & Commencement\", \"2. Applicability\").  \n",
    "     - Subsections (e.g., \"(a)\", \"(b)\", \"(i)\", or detailed text with lists).  \n",
    "   - Strip any HTML tags (e.g., `<span style=\"...\">`) and retain only the plain text content, preserving the meaning and structure.  \n",
    "   - For the introductory section, treat it as a standalone section under `Chapter: General` with no `Section No.` or `Section` title, as shown in the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CSV Structure**:  \n",
    "   - Create a CSV table with the following columns:  \n",
    "     - `Chapter`: The chapter number and title (e.g., \"I - Preliminary\", \"II - Role of the Regulated Entity\").  \n",
    "     - `Section No.`: The section number (e.g., \"1\", \"2\", or empty for chapter-level entries or the introductory section).  \n",
    "     - `Section`: The section title (e.g., \"Short Title & Commencement\", \"Applicability\", or empty for the introductory section).  \n",
    "     - `Sub-Section`: The subsection identifier or full text of the subsection (e.g., \"(a)\", \"(b)\", or detailed text including lists or conditions, as shown in the example).  \n",
    "     - `TPM Policy sub point`: The corresponding policy reference (e.g., \"1.2 Definition\", \"3.2 Supplier engagement process (Procurement FIM)\") or \"not specifically mentioned\" if no reference applies.  \n",
    "   - Each row should represent a section or subsection, with chapter-level entries (e.g., introductory section) included as needed.  \n",
    "   - For sections with multiple subsections (e.g., Section 16 in Chapter V with clauses a–w), group related clauses into a single row (e.g., a–f, g–m, n–s, t–w) to match the example format, ensuring all clauses are included concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Content Extraction and Summarization**:  \n",
    "   - For the introductory section, summarize the purpose in the `Sub-Section` column (e.g., \"The RBI issued these Directions to regulate outsourcing of IT and IT-enabled Services by Regulated Entities to manage risks, ensuring no compromise to customer obligations or RBI supervision.\") if no specific subsection text is provided.  \n",
    "   - For numbered sections and subsections, extract the exact text as provided in the document, removing HTML tags and formatting.  \n",
    "   - For subsections with detailed lists or conditions (e.g., Section 1(I)(i), 16(a)–(w)), include the full text in the `Sub-Section` column, ensuring clarity and completeness.  \n",
    "   - Assign `TPM Policy sub point` values based on the provided example data. Use the following references where applicable, or \"not specifically mentioned\" if no reference is provided:  \n",
    "     - \"1.1B\" (e.g., for applicability to specific entities).  \n",
    "     - \"1.2 Definition\" (e.g., for definitions like \"Group\", \"Material Outsourcing\").  \n",
    "     - \"1.2 Definition of TPEM, 9. Governance, roles and responsibilities\" (e.g., for regulatory obligations).  \n",
    "     - \"3.2 Supplier engagement process (Procurement FIM)\" (e.g., for agreements, conflicts of interest).  \n",
    "     - \"Section 3\" (e.g., for outsourcing need assessment).  \n",
    "     - \"4.3 Outsourcing assessments\" (e.g., for compliance with laws).  \n",
    "     - \"10. Redressal of customer grievances\" (e.g., for grievance mechanisms).  \n",
    "     - \"6.4 Outsourcing register\" (e.g., for inventory of services).  \n",
    "     - \"9.1 Country Governance\" (e.g., for IT outsourcing policy).  \n",
    "     - \"9. Governance, Roles and Responsibilities\" (e.g., for Board roles).  \n",
    "     - \"3.6 IT Governance\" (e.g., for Senior Management roles).  \n",
    "     - \"3. Engagement Initiation: Pre-Requisite Activities\" (e.g., for due diligence).  \n",
    "     - \"3. Engagement Initiation: Pre-Requisite Activities, 4. Third Party Assessment\" (e.g., for due diligence aspects).  \n",
    "     - \"4. Third Party Assessment, 7.2 Ongoing Risk Management, 6. Approval Requirements for Outsourcing engagements, 3.2.5 Information Security Review, 3. Sub-contracting\" (e.g., for risk management framework).  \n",
    "     - \"3.2.3 Business Continuity Plan\" (e.g., for BCP requirements).  \n",
    "     - \"3.2.4 Exit Strategy Plan\" (e.g., for contingency plans).  \n",
    "     - \"3.2.5 Information Security Review, 3.5 Data sharing approval\" (e.g., for data isolation).  \n",
    "     - \"7.1.2 Monitoring performance metrics\" (e.g., for monitoring structures).  \n",
    "     - \"7.4 Independent Review / Audit Review\" (e.g., for audits).  \n",
    "     - \"8.4 Disengagement / Termination\" (e.g., for termination publicity).  \n",
    "     - \"5.1 Supplier agreements\" (e.g., for access to data).  \n",
    "     - \"Definition\" (e.g., for group outsourcing).  \n",
    "     - \"1.3. Intended Audience and Outcomes\" (e.g., for group entity selection).  \n",
    "     - \"1.1.B Notes, 5.2.4 Transfer Pricing and Taxation, 1.3. Intended Audience and Outcomes\" (e.g., for arm's length relationships).  \n",
    "     - \"3.8 Additional guidelines laid down by RBI for off-shore outsourcing\" (e.g., for cross-border requirements).  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CSV Formatting**:  \n",
    "   - Ensure the output is a valid CSV format with comma-separated values.  \n",
    "   - Enclose fields in double quotes (`\"`) if they contain commas, quotes, or newlines to prevent parsing errors (e.g., `\"I - Preliminary\"`, `\"The RBI issued these Directions, ensuring compliance\"`).  \n",
    "   - Include a header row with the column names: `Chapter`, `Section No.`, `Section`, `Sub-Section`, `TPM Policy sub point`.  \n",
    "   - Avoid including non-CSV content (e.g., notes, comments) within the CSV. If a note is needed, place it outside the CSV content, after the closing ``` marker.  \n",
    "   - Ensure each row has exactly 5 columns, matching the headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling Special Cases**:  \n",
    "   - For the introductory section, use `Chapter: General`, leave `Section No.` and `Section` empty, and provide a summarized description in `Sub-Section` (e.g., \"The RBI issued these Directions to regulate outsourcing of IT and IT-enabled Services by Regulated Entities to manage risks, ensuring no compromise to customer obligations or RBI supervision.\").  \n",
    "   - For sections with complex subsections (e.g., Section 16 in Chapter V), group clauses into logical sets (e.g., a–f, g–m, n–s, t–w) to match the example format, ensuring all clauses are included in the `Sub-Section` column.  \n",
    "   - For definitions (Section 3), include each defined term (e.g., \"Group\", \"Material Outsourcing\") as a separate row with its definition in `Sub-Section`.  \n",
    "   - If the document contains ambiguities (e.g., unclear section boundaries), assume the structure follows the provided example and assign `TPM Policy sub point` as \"not specifically mentioned\" unless a clear match exists.  \n",
    "   - Remove footnotes (e.g., \"2*\", \"3*\") and their explanations, including them only if part of the main subsection text.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output Requirements**:  \n",
    "   - Provide the CSV content as plain text within triple backticks (```csv ... ```) to ensure proper formatting.  \n",
    "   - Include the introductory section and all relevant sections from Chapters I to X, excluding the index and appendices.  \n",
    "   - If the document is too large to process fully, provide a complete CSV for the introductory section, Chapter I, and Chapter II, and include a note outside the CSV indicating that the structure can be extended to remaining chapters.  \n",
    "   - Ensure the CSV is valid and can be parsed by standard CSV parsers (e.g., Python’s `csv` module).  \n",
    "   - Users should be able to copy the CSV content into a text editor and save it as `rbi_it_outsourcing.csv` for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Constraints**:  \n",
    "   - Do not generate images or other non-text outputs.  \n",
    "   - Do not modify the document’s content or invent details; base all entries on the provided text.  \n",
    "   - If any part of the document is unclear (e.g., missing section titles), make reasonable assumptions based on context and note them in a comment outside the CSV (e.g., \"Assumed introductory section summary based on document purpose\").  \n",
    "   - Exclude the index and appendices, even if referenced in the main text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Example Output Format**:  \n",
    "```csv\n",
